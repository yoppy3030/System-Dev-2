        <h1>Introduction to the Chubu Region</h1>
        <p>The Chūbu Region, meaning “central region,” lies in the very heart of Japan’s main island, Honshu, bridging the bustling cities of Kanto in the east and the cultural traditions of Kansai in the west. Known for its dramatic contrasts, Chūbu stretches from the rugged peaks of the Japanese Alps to the serene coastline along the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean.
            The region includes nine diverse prefectures—from industrial hubs like Aichi (home to Toyota) to spiritual centers like Nagano and historic towns like Kanazawa in Ishikawa. Chūbu is famous for its natural beauty, traditional craftsmanship, unique local foods, and deep-rooted mountain culture. Whether you’re skiing in Nagano, soaking in an onsen in Gifu, exploring miso factories in Aichi,
            or hiking through sacred forests in Yamanashi, the Chūbu Region offers a rich, authentic slice of Japan that blends history, nature, and innovation.</p>

        <ol>

            <h2> Chubu region</h2>

            <!-- Nagano Section -->
            <h2>1. Nagano</h2>
            <ul class="rules-list">

                <li>
                    <h3>1. Don’t Treat Zenkoji Like a Tourist Attraction Only</h3>
                    <p>While Zenkoji Temple in Nagano is a popular sightseeing spot, it remains one of Japan’s most sacred and active places of worship. Many visitors come not just to look around, but to pray, reflect, and follow centuries-old rituals. Tourists should be mindful of their behavior — walking quietly, avoiding selfies in sacred spaces, and showing respect by bowing at the temple gate.
                        It’s also customary to experience the “okaidan meguri,” a symbolic journey in complete darkness beneath the main hall, meant to purify the soul. Approaching Zenkoji with the same reverence as the pilgrims who travel there will lead to a more meaningful and respectful visit.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>2. Don’t Feed or Touch the Snow Monkeys</h3>
                    <p>At Jigokudani Monkey Park in Nagano, the sight of wild Japanese macaques relaxing in hot springs is truly unforgettable — but it’s important to remember that these monkeys are not pets or performers. They come and go freely, and locals work hard to protect their natural behavior. Tourists should never try to feed, touch, or provoke them for photos, as this can cause stress, aggression, or even disrupt their delicate ecosystem.
                        Getting too close or making loud noises may also make them feel threatened. The best way to enjoy this rare and peaceful scene is to observe quietly and respectfully from a safe distance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>3. Don’t Pick Fruit Without Permission</h3>
                    <p>Nagano is famous for its delicious apples, grapes, and other seasonal fruits, and you’ll often see orchards and farms lining the countryside. While it may be tempting to reach out and grab a ripe apple or bunch of grapes, doing so without permission is considered trespassing and disrespectful. These fruits are carefully grown by local farmers and are part of their livelihood. Many orchards offer fruit-picking experiences, but only in designated areas and with payment.
                        If you’d like to try picking fruit, look for signs that say “果物狩り OK” or ask staff politely. Always treat farmland with the same respect you would a private home.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Don’t Take Part in the Onbashira Festival Lightly</h3>
                    <p>Held once every six years in the Suwa region of Nagano, the Onbashira Festival is one of Japan’s most thrilling and sacred events. Participants ride massive tree trunks down steep slopes and pull them through towns to re-erect at Suwa Taisha Shrine. While it might look like an adventurous and exciting spectacle, the festival is deeply rooted in Shinto beliefs and local pride, and it involves real physical danger.
                        Tourists should never try to join on a whim or treat it as a fun stunt — injuries and even fatalities have occurred. Instead, visitors are encouraged to watch from safe zones,
                        learn about the spiritual meaning behind the rituals, and show deep respect for the bravery and tradition of the local people who carry it out.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>5. Don’t Skip the Bow at Shrines (Especially at Togakushi and Suwa)</h3>
                    <p>In Nagano, shrines like Togakushi Shrine and Suwa Taisha are not just beautiful landmarks — they are sacred places deeply connected to nature, history, and spirituality. When visiting, it’s important to follow basic Shinto etiquette. Always bow once before entering the torii gate,
                        walk along the sides of the path (never down the center, which is reserved for the gods), and bow again when you leave.This simple act of respect shows your understanding of local customs and helps preserve the spiritual atmosphere of the site. Skipping the bow or behaving too casually,
                        especially at these spiritually important shrines, may come across as disrespectful to both the place and the people who care for it.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Aichi Section -->
            <h2>2. Aichi</h2>
            <ul class="rules-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Don’t Call Hatcho Miso “Too Strong”</h3>
                    <p>Hatcho miso is a deep, dark red miso that’s been fermented for over two years — a specialty of Aichi, especially in Okazaki. Its rich, bold flavor is very different from the lighter miso used in other parts of Japan, and locals are incredibly proud of it.
                        Dishes like miso katsu or miso nikomi udon are made with this strong miso base, and they represent the heart of the region’s culinary identity. Even if the taste is unusual or intense for some visitors,
                        it’s important not to criticize it openly by saying things like “too strong” or “too salty.” Instead, show interest or appreciation, as this miso reflects generations of tradition and pride in Aichi's food culture.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>2. Don’t Eat Tebasaki (Chicken Wings) Carelessly</h3>
                    <p>Tebasaki — seasoned, crispy chicken wings — are one of Aichi’s most iconic local dishes, especially popular in Nagoya’s izakayas like Yamachan and Furaibo. Unlike typical wings, tebasaki are eaten with a specific technique: twisting the bone and pulling the meat off cleanly with your hands. Locals take pride in eating them neatly and savoring the flavor.
                        Tourists should avoid picking at them messily, leaving bones half-eaten, or complaining about the sticky hands — it’s all part of the fun and flavor. Watching how locals eat and giving it a respectful try is the best way to enjoy this Nagoya specialty.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>3. Don’t Mishandle Karakuri Puppets</h3>
                    <p>Karakuri puppets are traditional mechanical dolls that originate from Aichi, especially in cities like Inuyama and Nagoya. These beautifully crafted figures are powered by springs and gears — no electricity — and can perform complex movements such as serving tea or dancing. Far from being simple toys, they are a treasured part of Aichi’s craftsmanship culture and often appear in local festivals and exhibitions.
                        Tourists should avoid touching the puppets, leaning in too close for photos, or comparing them casually to robots or anime figures. Mishandling or underestimating their cultural value may come across as disrespectful. Observing with care and curiosity shows appreciation for the incredible artistry behind these living traditions.</p>
                    <img src="./img/fire_work.jpg" alt="Chiba Festival" class="festival-image">

                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>4. Don’t Treat Ebi Senbei as Just “Snacks”</h3>
                    <p>Ebi senbei — shrimp-flavored rice crackers — are a beloved specialty of Aichi, especially in coastal areas like Mikawa and Chita. While they may look like simple snacks, these crackers are often handmade with local shrimp and come in a wide range of flavors, textures, and packaging designs. For locals, ebi senbei are not just something to eat casually — they’re a popular form of omiyage (souvenir gift), meant to be shared with friends,
                        coworkers, or family after a trip. Treating them like cheap junk food or tossing them aside without trying them can come off as rude. Respecting them as a thoughtful and meaningful gift shows good manners and appreciation for Aichi’s local traditions.

                </li>

            </ul>
            <!-- Shizuoka Section -->
            <ul class="rules-list">
                <h2>3. Shizuoka</h2>
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Don’t Walk Through Tea Fields or Touch the Leaves Without Permission</h3>
                    <p>Shizuoka is Japan’s largest tea producer, and tea farms are often mistaken for open tourist spaces. In reality, they are carefully maintained by farmers.
                        Walking into the rows, picking leaves, or stepping on the soil damages the crop and disrespects the growers. Unless you are in a guided tour area, stay on marked paths and never enter the fields freely.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>2. Don’t Add Too Much Wasabi or Soy Sauce</h3>
                    <p>Shizuoka is famous for producing the highest quality fresh wasabi in Japan, as well as top-grade seafood like tuna, sakura shrimp, and shirasu (whitebait). When enjoying local sushi or sashimi, it’s important to use condiments with care. Smothering your food with soy sauce or piling on wasabi is considered bad manners — and can even offend the chef.
                        Fresh wasabi has a delicate, clean flavor that’s meant to enhance, not overpower, the taste of the fish. The local custom is to add just a small amount, or let the chef apply it for you. Using sauces modestly shows respect for the ingredients, the chef’s skill, and Shizuoka’s proud food culture.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>3. Don’t Take Photos of Farmers Without Permission</h3>
                    <p>In Shizuoka, you’ll often see tea farmers working in scenic green fields or fishermen busy in coastal towns — and while these scenes may seem picture-perfect, they are part of people’s real, everyday lives. It’s important to remember that farmers and workers are not tourist attractions. Taking photos without asking can feel intrusive or disrespectful, especially in rural areas where privacy is valued.
                        If you wish to capture a moment, simply offer a polite gesture or ask with a smile — many locals will happily agree if approached respectfully. Showing this courtesy honors their hard work and helps preserve trust between visitors and the community.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Don’t Treat Mt. Fuji Like a Simple Tourist Hike </h3>
                    <p>Mount Fuji, especially from the Shizuoka side, is more than just a famous mountain — it is a sacred symbol deeply tied to Japan’s spiritual and cultural heritage. While many tourists visit to enjoy the view or challenge themselves with a climb, it’s important to recognize that Fuji-san has long been a site of pilgrimage and worship. Treating it like a casual hike or photo spot can come off as insensitive.
                        Always follow seasonal access rules, stay on marked trails, and respect any restricted areas. Littering, shouting, or playing music on the trail not only disturbs others but also goes against the respectful atmosphere that locals expect. Climbing Mt. Fuji is a special experience — approach it with humility and care.</p>
            </ul>
            <!-- Gifu  Section -->
            <h2>4. Gifu </h2>
            <ul class="rules-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Don’t Touch or Enter Private Homes in Shirakawa-go</h3>
                    <p>Shirakawa-go, with its iconic thatched-roof farmhouses, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site — but it’s also a living village where people still reside. While some homes are open to the public as museums or inns, many others are private properties. Tourists should be careful not to treat the entire village like an open-air exhibit.
                        Avoid touching the wooden walls, peeking through windows, or walking into side paths marked as restricted. Even leaning on fences or standing too close for photos can feel intrusive to the residents. Respecting the privacy and daily lives of the locals helps preserve the harmony between tourism and tradition in this unique community.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>2. Be Careful When Taking Photos in Traditional Towns Like Takayama</h3>
                    <p>The historic streets of Takayama, especially areas like Sanmachi Suji, are beautifully preserved and attract many visitors with their Edo-period charm. However, these areas are not just tourist spots — they are also home to local residents and businesses. Tourists should avoid blocking narrow walkways, setting up tripods in busy areas, or taking photos of people or shop interiors without permission.
                        Some places may have signs that say “撮影禁止” (no photography) — these should always be respected. Being mindful of your surroundings and photographing discreetly helps maintain the peaceful atmosphere that makes Takayama so special.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>3. Don’t Mishandle or Joke About Blades in Seki</h3>
                    <p>Seki City in Gifu is known across Japan — and even worldwide — for its masterful blade craftsmanship, with a history of sword-making that dates back over 700 years. Whether it’s a samurai katana or a finely made kitchen knife, blades from Seki are treated with deep respect. When visiting knife shops, museums, or workshops, it’s important to remember that these items are not souvenirs or toys.
                        Avoid pretending to fight with them, posing for silly photos, or grabbing them without asking. Mishandling a blade not only risks injury but also shows a lack of appreciation for the cultural and spiritual significance behind the craft. Always handle them with care, and follow staff instructions when observing or purchasing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Don’t Dance Carelessly in Gujo Odori</h3>
                    <p>Gujo Odori, held in Gujo Hachiman, is one of Japan’s longest and most cherished traditional dance festivals, running for over 30 nights each summer.
                        Unlike stage performances, this is a community-centered event where locals and visitors dance together in the streets to preserve centuries-old traditions. While tourists are warmly welcomed to join,
                        it’s important to follow the rhythm and style of the dances rather than freestyle or make exaggerated moves. Watch others, learn the basic steps, and join with respect. Taking over the circle, filming in the center, or treating it as a performance for social media can be seen as disrespectful. The heart of Gujo Odori is in dancing with the community — not standing out from it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>5. Don’t Interrupt or Flash Photography During Cormorant Fishing (Ukai)</h3>
                    <p>Ukai, or traditional cormorant fishing, is a centuries-old ritual held on the Nagara River in Gifu City. It’s not just a tourist show — it’s a living cultural heritage, performed with deep skill and spiritual significance. As night falls, fishermen in traditional robes guide trained cormorants to catch fish by torchlight, creating a quiet and mesmerizing scene. Tourists are welcome to watch,
                         but flash photography is strictly discouraged, as it can startle the birds and break their concentration. Likewise, shouting, cheering, or waving from boats is considered disruptive. To truly appreciate Ukai, observe silently, keep your camera settings on low light or no flash, and let the ancient rhythm of the performance speak for itself.</p>
