                            <h3>1.  Awa Odori Dance Etiquette</h3>
                            <img src="./img/awa_odori.jpg" alt="Awa Odori Festival" class="festival-image"><br>
                            <p>Awa Odori, held every August in Tokushima City, is one of Japan's most iconic and energetic dance festivals, attracting thousands of performers and spectators. While the festival is filled with joyful music,
                                 lively chants, and vibrant movement, it's also a deeply rooted cultural tradition with over 400 years of history. For locals, Awa Odori is not just entertainment — it's a symbol of identity and community spirit.
                                  Visitors are welcome to enjoy the atmosphere and may even be invited to join in designated "niwaka-ren" (casual dance groups). However, mocking the dance, interrupting performers, or stepping into processions for selfies is considered very disrespectful.
                                   Proper etiquette means watching with appreciation, following staff directions, and joining respectfully if invited. Treating the event with the same spirit of joy and reverence as the locals helps preserve its proud legacy.</p>

                            <h3>2.   Respect for Henro Pilgrims    </h3>
                            <p>Tokushima is the starting point of the Shikoku Henro, a sacred 88-temple pilgrimage route that spans over 1,200 kilometers across the island. Many pilgrims (called ohenro-san) walk for weeks or even months, dressed in white robes and straw hats, seeking spiritual growth,
                                 healing, or personal reflection. In Tokushima, it's common to see these pilgrims quietly making their way through towns, mountains, and temple grounds. Locals often offer small gifts or words of encouragement, and visitors are encouraged to show the same respect. It's important not to interrupt their rituals, 
                                 take photos without permission, or make light of their journey. Offering a quiet nod or a simple "ganbatte kudasai" (do your best) is a thoughtful way to acknowledge their commitment. The Henro path is not a tourist attraction — it's a living spiritual tradition that deserves reverence.</p>

                            <h3>3.   Respect at Naruto Whirlpools</h3>
                            <p>The Naruto Whirlpools, located between Tokushima and Awaji Island, are one of Japan's most dramatic natural wonders, caused by powerful tidal currents swirling through the Naruto Strait. While the sight is thrilling and draws many tourists, it also holds cultural and environmental significance for locals.
                                 When visiting by sightseeing boat or from viewing platforms like the Ōnaruto Bridge Walk, visitors are expected to behave respectfully. Shouting, throwing objects into the water, or treating the area like an amusement spot is frowned upon. The whirlpools are part of Tokushima's pride, and locals take their preservation seriously.
                                  Observing in quiet awe, taking care not to disturb the environment, and following tour staff instructions helps maintain the dignity of this natural phenomenon.</p>

                            <h3>1. Izakaya Manners: The "Otōshi" and First Pour</h3>
                            <p>In Kochi, dining and drinking are not just about food — they're about connection and ritual. When visiting an izakaya (Japanese pub), you'll typically be served a small appetizer called "otōshi" as soon as you sit down. Even if you didn't order it, it's a standard part of the dining experience and a sign of hospitality —
                                 not something to refuse or leave untouched. More importantly, Kochi's people are known for their warm and lively drinking culture, where pouring drinks for others is a key sign of respect. It's considered poor manners to pour your own drink; instead, you should pour for your companions and let them return the gesture.
                                  This simple act reflects the strong sense of social bonding and mutual care that defines Kochi's cheerful, community-oriented spirit.</p>

                            <p>The Shimanto River, often called "Japan's last clear stream," is one of Kochi's most treasured natural landmarks. Flowing through unspoiled countryside, it represents the region's deep connection to clean water, sustainable living, and traditional fishing. Visitors often come to enjoy canoeing, cycling,
                                 and scenic walks along its banks — but this beauty comes with responsibility. Locals take great care to preserve the river's purity, so littering, disturbing wildlife, or swimming recklessly is strongly discouraged. Traditional fishing methods, such as ukai (cormorant fishing) or yubiki (hand fishing),
                                  are still practiced here and should be observed with quiet respect. Whether you're relaxing on the riverbanks or crossing one of the famous chinkabashi (submersible bridges), treating the Shimanto River gently ensures that this rare natural treasure remains pristine for generations to come.</p>

                            <img src="./img/sakamoto.jpg" alt="Sakamoto Ryoma" class="samurai-image"><br>

                            <p>In Kochi, few historical figures are held in higher esteem than Sakamoto Ryoma, a visionary samurai who played a pivotal role in modernizing Japan during the final years of the Edo period. Born in Kochi, Ryoma is celebrated for his progressive ideals, efforts to unify rival domains, and push for peaceful political reform.
                                 Statues, museums, and even airports in Kochi proudly bear his name, reflecting the deep respect locals have for his legacy. When visiting sites associated with Ryoma — such as Katsurahama Beach, Sakamoto Ryoma Memorial Museum, or his childhood home — it's important to treat them with the same reverence that residents do. 
                                 Making light of his story or treating historical locations as casual photo spots can come off as insensitive. By learning about his life and showing respect, visitors can better appreciate the pride and identity that Ryoma continues to inspire in Kochi today.</p>

                            <p>The Shimanami Kaidō is one of Japan's most scenic cycling routes, stretching about 70 kilometers and connecting Ehime Prefecture to Hiroshima across a chain of islands via impressive bridges.
                                 While it's popular with cyclists from around the world, it's also used daily by local residents, families, and even schoolchildren. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy the breathtaking views at a relaxed pace,
                                  but also to ride responsibly and courteously. That means keeping to the left, yielding to slower riders, avoiding loud music, and not treating the route like a racetrack. This shared path blends tourism and everyday life,
                                   so respecting the flow and presence of others ensures a safe and pleasant experience for everyone. Riding with mindfulness allows you to connect not just with the landscape — but with the rhythm of island life itself.</p>

                            <h3>2.  Understand the Literary Legacy of Natsume Sōseki</h3>
                                <p>Ehime holds a special place in Japanese literary history thanks to Natsume Sōseki, one of Japan's most celebrated authors. His novel "Botchan", written in 1906, is set in Matsuyama and remains a beloved story across Japan.
                                     The tale follows a young Tokyo teacher adjusting to rural life, capturing both humor and the cultural contrasts of the time. Today, landmarks like the Botchan Train, Dōgo Onsen, and various statues and museums in Matsuyama proudly honor the story.
                                      For locals, "Botchan" is more than just a book — it's a part of their cultural identity. While visitors are welcome to explore and even enjoy the playful elements tied to the novel, treating it lightly or mocking the characters can feel disrespectful. 
                                        Showing genuine interest in Sōseki's work and its connection to Ehime adds a thoughtful layer to your visit and demonstrates appreciation for the region's literary pride.</p>

                                <p>Ehime Prefecture is often called the “Kingdom of Mikan,” thanks to its ideal climate and long history of producing some of Japan’s sweetest and juiciest mandarin oranges. For locals, mikan are more than just a fruit — they’re a symbol of warmth, hospitality,
                                     and regional pride. You’ll find mikan used in everything from juice and jam to desserts and bath products. Many families even grow their own. When visiting Ehime, it’s important to treat mikan with respect: don’t waste them, don’t scoff at their simplicity,
                                      and don’t compare them negatively to foreign fruits. Complimenting their flavor, trying different varieties, or learning about mikan farming traditions is a great way to connect with the heart of Ehime’s culture — one sweet bite at a time.</p>

                                <p>Matsuyama Castle is one of Japan's few surviving original castles and a treasured symbol of Ehime's history and pride. Perched on a hill overlooking the city, the castle grounds are not only a major tourist attraction but also a place of quiet beauty and reflection for locals.
                                     Visitors are expected to behave respectfully while exploring the site — that means avoiding loud conversations, rough play, or taking silly or disrespectful selfies near historical structures. Walking carefully, appreciating the architecture,
                                      and observing signs and rules help preserve the dignity of this cultural landmark. Treating the castle and its surroundings with reverence not only honors the legacy of the past but also ensures that future generations can enjoy its atmosphere of quiet strength and heritage.</p>

                            <p>Kagawa Prefecture is proudly known as the home of Sanuki udon, a thick and chewy noodle that has become a symbol of the region's identity. For locals, udon isn't just a quick meal — it's a carefully crafted dish that reflects centuries of culinary tradition. When dining at udon shops in Kagawa,
                                 there are a few unspoken rules to follow. First, don't rush — even though many shops are casual and self-serve, slurping down your bowl without appreciating the flavor and texture is seen as missing the point. Second, avoid over-seasoning — Sanuki udon is known for its subtle balance of flavors,
                                  so adding too much soy sauce, chili flakes, or other condiments before tasting is discouraged. Lastly, treat the staff and other diners with quiet courtesy; these shops are often busy, but the atmosphere remains calm and respectful. By enjoying udon the local way, you're not just eating — you're participating in a beloved part of Kagawa's culture.</p>

                            <p>Local markets in Kagawa, especially in cities like Takamatsu and Marugame, are places where community life and fresh produce meet. While they may seem relaxed and friendly — and they are — there are still important manners to follow. Haggling is generally not practiced, unlike in some other countries.
                                 Prices are usually fair and fixed, and trying to bargain can make vendors uncomfortable or even offended. Instead, polite greetings, showing genuine interest in products, and thanking sellers go a long way. It's also important not to block narrow aisles or stand too long in front of stalls without buying,
                                  as this can disrupt the flow of customers. Taking photos without asking may also be frowned upon. Visiting these markets with quiet curiosity and respect helps preserve the welcoming atmosphere and supports the hardworking locals who make Kagawa's food culture so special.</p>

                            <p>The islands of Naoshima and Teshima in Kagawa Prefecture are internationally renowned for their stunning blend of nature, architecture, and contemporary art. Home to world-class museums like the Chichu Art Museum and Teshima Art Museum, these islands offer immersive experiences that invite quiet reflection rather than casual tourism.
                                 Many of the artworks are designed to interact with light, space, and silence — and touching them, leaning on installations, or taking disruptive selfies can damage both the art and the atmosphere. Photography is restricted in many areas, and rules vary depending on the exhibit. Visitors are expected to move slowly, speak softly,
                                  and follow all posted guidelines. Treating these islands not just as photo ops, but as places to truly engage with creativity and thought, reflects the respect these artistic sanctuaries deserve.</p>
