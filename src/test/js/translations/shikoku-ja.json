    "Introduction to the Shikoku Region": "四国地方の紹介",
    "Shikoku, the smallest of Japan's four main islands, is a region rich in spiritual heritage, natural beauty, and traditional charm. Comprising four prefectures — Tokushima, Kagawa, Ehime, and Kochi — Shikoku is best known for the Shikoku Henro, a sacred 88-temple pilgrimage route that draws both devout followers and curious travelers from across the world. Beyond its spiritual appeal, Shikoku offers stunning coastlines, lush mountains, and vibrant local cultures. Kagawa is famed for its udon noodles, Tokushima for its Awa Odori dance festival, Ehime for its historic Dogo Onsen, and Kochi for its rivers and samurai history. Far less crowded than Japan's major cities, Shikoku welcomes visitors with warm hospitality and a pace of life that invites reflection and connection with both people and place.": "四国は日本の四つの主要な島の中で最も小さく、精神的な遺産や自然美、伝統的な魅力にあふれた地域です。徳島、香川、愛媛、高知の4県からなり、特に88ヶ所巡礼（四国遍路）で有名です。美しい海岸線や山々、活気ある地域文化も魅力で、香川はうどん、徳島は阿波踊り、愛媛は道後温泉、高知は清流や坂本龍馬の歴史で知られています。大都市に比べて人が少なく、温かいおもてなしとゆったりとした時間が流れる四国は、訪れる人々に心の安らぎと人とのつながりをもたらします。",

    "Shikoku region": "四国地方",

    "1. Tokushima": "1. 徳島",
    "1. Awa Odori Dance Etiquette": "1. 阿波踊りのマナー",
    "Awa Odori, held every August in Tokushima City, is one of Japan's most iconic and energetic dance festivals, attracting thousands of performers and spectators. While the festival is filled with joyful music, lively chants, and vibrant movement, it's also a deeply rooted cultural tradition with over 400 years of history. For locals, Awa Odori is not just entertainment — it's a symbol of identity and community spirit. Visitors are welcome to enjoy the atmosphere and may even be invited to join in designated \"niwaka-ren\" (casual dance groups). However, mocking the dance, interrupting performers, or stepping into processions for selfies is considered very disrespectful. Proper etiquette means watching with appreciation, following staff directions, and joining respectfully if invited. Treating the event with the same spirit of joy and reverence as the locals helps preserve its proud legacy.": "徳島市で毎年8月に開催される阿波踊りは、日本を代表する活気あふれる踊りの祭りです。400年以上の歴史を持ち、地元の人々にとっては単なる娯楽ではなく、地域の誇りと絆の象徴です。観光客も雰囲気を楽しみ、時には「にわか連」と呼ばれるグループで参加することもできますが、踊りをからかったり、演者の邪魔をしたり、行列に割り込んで写真を撮るのは大変失礼です。マナーを守り、スタッフの指示に従い、招かれた場合は敬意を持って参加しましょう。地元の人と同じ気持ちで祭りを楽しむことが大切です。",

    "2. Respect for Henro Pilgrims": "2. 四国遍路の巡礼者への敬意",
    "Tokushima is the starting point of the Shikoku Henro, a sacred 88-temple pilgrimage route that spans over 1,200 kilometers across the island. Many pilgrims (called ohenro-san) walk for weeks or even months, dressed in white robes and straw hats, seeking spiritual growth, healing, or personal reflection. In Tokushima, it's common to see these pilgrims quietly making their way through towns, mountains, and temple grounds. Locals often offer small gifts or words of encouragement, and visitors are encouraged to show the same respect. It's important not to interrupt their rituals, take photos without permission, or make light of their journey. Offering a quiet nod or a simple \"ganbatte kudasai\" (do your best) is a thoughtful way to acknowledge their commitment. The Henro path is not a tourist attraction — it's a living spiritual tradition that deserves reverence.": "徳島は四国八十八ヶ所巡礼の出発点です。白装束に菅笠姿の巡礼者（お遍路さん）は、精神的な成長や癒しを求めて何週間も歩きます。地元の人はお接待や励ましの言葉をかけることが多く、観光客も同じように敬意を払いましょう。儀式の邪魔や無断撮影、巡礼を軽んじる行為は控え、静かに見守るか「頑張ってください」と声をかけるのが良いマナーです。遍路道は観光地ではなく、今も生きる信仰の道です。",

    "3. Respect at Naruto Whirlpools": "3. 鳴門の渦潮でのマナー",
    "The Naruto Whirlpools, located between Tokushima and Awaji Island, are one of Japan's most dramatic natural wonders, caused by powerful tidal currents swirling through the Naruto Strait. While the sight is thrilling and draws many tourists, it also holds cultural and environmental significance for locals. When visiting by sightseeing boat or from viewing platforms like the Ōnaruto Bridge Walk, visitors are expected to behave respectfully. Shouting, throwing objects into the water, or treating the area like an amusement spot is frowned upon. The whirlpools are part of Tokushima's pride, and locals take their preservation seriously. Observing in quiet awe, taking care not to disturb the environment, and following tour staff instructions helps maintain the dignity of this natural phenomenon.": "徳島と淡路島の間にある鳴門の渦潮は、日本有数の自然現象です。観光客に人気ですが、地元の人にとっては誇りであり、環境保護の意識も高い場所です。遊覧船や展望台から見学する際は、大声を出したり、物を投げたり、遊び場のように扱うのは控えましょう。静かに観察し、環境を乱さず、スタッフの指示に従うことが大切です。",

    "2. Kochi": "2. 高知",
    "1. Izakaya Manners: The \"Otōshi\" and First Pour": "1. 居酒屋のマナー：お通しと最初の一杯",
    "In Kochi, dining and drinking are not just about food — they're about connection and ritual. When visiting an izakaya (Japanese pub), you'll typically be served a small appetizer called \"otōshi\" as soon as you sit down. Even if you didn't order it, it's a standard part of the dining experience and a sign of hospitality — not something to refuse or leave untouched. More importantly, Kochi's people are known for their warm and lively drinking culture, where pouring drinks for others is a key sign of respect. It's considered poor manners to pour your own drink; instead, you should pour for your companions and let them return the gesture. This simple act reflects the strong sense of social bonding and mutual care that defines Kochi's cheerful, community-oriented spirit.": "高知の居酒屋では、席に着くと「お通し」と呼ばれる小皿料理が出されます。これは注文しなくても出てくるもので、おもてなしの一環なので断らずにいただきましょう。また、高知では自分でお酒を注ぐのはマナー違反とされ、仲間同士で注ぎ合うのが礼儀です。この習慣は、温かく賑やかな高知の人々の絆を象徴しています。",

    "2. Be Gentle Around the Shimanto River": "2. 四万十川を大切に",
    "The Shimanto River, often called \"Japan's last clear stream,\" is one of Kochi's most treasured natural landmarks. Flowing through unspoiled countryside, it represents the region's deep connection to clean water, sustainable living, and traditional fishing. Visitors often come to enjoy canoeing, cycling, and scenic walks along its banks — but this beauty comes with responsibility. Locals take great care to preserve the river's purity, so littering, disturbing wildlife, or swimming recklessly is strongly discouraged. Traditional fishing methods, such as ukai (cormorant fishing) or yubiki (hand fishing), are still practiced here and should be observed with quiet respect. Whether you're relaxing on the riverbanks or crossing one of the famous chinkabashi (submersible bridges), treating the Shimanto River gently ensures that this rare natural treasure remains pristine for generations to come.": "四万十川は「日本最後の清流」と呼ばれ、高知の宝です。カヌーやサイクリング、散策が人気ですが、ゴミを捨てたり、動植物を乱したり、危険な遊泳は厳禁です。伝統的な漁法も今なお守られているので、静かに見学しましょう。川や沈下橋を大切に扱うことで、この自然が未来にも残ります。",

    "3. Honor the Samurai Legacy of Sakamoto Ryoma": "3. 坂本龍馬の歴史を尊重",
    "In Kochi, few historical figures are held in higher esteem than Sakamoto Ryoma, a visionary samurai who played a pivotal role in modernizing Japan during the final years of the Edo period. Born in Kochi, Ryoma is celebrated for his progressive ideals, efforts to unify rival domains, and push for peaceful political reform. Statues, museums, and even airports in Kochi proudly bear his name, reflecting the deep respect locals have for his legacy. When visiting sites associated with Ryoma — such as Katsurahama Beach, Sakamoto Ryoma Memorial Museum, or his childhood home — it's important to treat them with the same reverence that residents do. Making light of his story or treating historical locations as casual photo spots can come off as insensitive. By learning about his life and showing respect, visitors can better appreciate the pride and identity that Ryoma continues to inspire in Kochi today.": "高知出身の坂本龍馬は、幕末の日本を変えた偉人として地元で深く敬愛されています。桂浜や記念館、ゆかりの地を訪れる際は、歴史や人物への敬意を持って見学しましょう。ふざけた写真撮影や軽い扱いは控え、龍馬の生涯や功績を知ることで、高知の誇りをより感じられます。",

    "3. Ehime": "3. 愛媛",
    "1. Be Courteous on the Shimanami Kaidō": "1. しまなみ海道でのマナー",
    "The Shimanami Kaidō is one of Japan's most scenic cycling routes, stretching about 70 kilometers and connecting Ehime Prefecture to Hiroshima across a chain of islands via impressive bridges. While it's popular with cyclists from around the world, it's also used daily by local residents, families, and even schoolchildren. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy the breathtaking views at a relaxed pace, but also to ride responsibly and courteously. That means keeping to the left, yielding to slower riders, avoiding loud music, and not treating the route like a racetrack. This shared path blends tourism and everyday life, so respecting the flow and presence of others ensures a safe and pleasant experience for everyone. Riding with mindfulness allows you to connect not just with the landscape — but with the rhythm of island life itself.": "しまなみ海道は、愛媛と広島を結ぶ約70kmの絶景サイクリングロードです。観光客だけでなく地元の人々も日常的に利用しているため、左側通行や追い越し時の配慮、大音量の音楽を控えるなど、周囲への思いやりを持って走りましょう。観光と生活が共存する道なので、みんなが気持ちよく利用できるよう心がけてください。",

    "2. Understand the Literary Legacy of Natsume Sōseki": "2. 夏目漱石と「坊っちゃん」の世界",
    "Ehime holds a special place in Japanese literary history thanks to Natsume Sōseki, one of Japan's most celebrated authors. His novel \"Botchan\", written in 1906, is set in Matsuyama and remains a beloved story across Japan. The tale follows a young Tokyo teacher adjusting to rural life, capturing both humor and the cultural contrasts of the time. Today, landmarks like the Botchan Train, Dōgo Onsen, and various statues and museums in Matsuyama proudly honor the story. For locals, \"Botchan\" is more than just a book — it's a part of their cultural identity. While visitors are welcome to explore and even enjoy the playful elements tied to the novel, treating it lightly or mocking the characters can feel disrespectful. Showing genuine interest in Sōseki's work and its connection to Ehime adds a thoughtful layer to your visit and demonstrates appreciation for the region's literary pride.": "愛媛は夏目漱石の小説『坊っちゃん』の舞台として有名です。松山には坊っちゃん列車や道後温泉など、物語にちなんだ名所が多くあります。地元の人にとって『坊っちゃん』は文化の一部なので、作品や登場人物を軽んじたり、からかったりせず、興味を持って接することで、愛媛の文学的な誇りをより深く感じられます。",

    "3. Appreciate Mikan Culture": "3. みかん文化を楽しむ",
    "Ehime Prefecture is often called the \"Kingdom of Mikan,\" thanks to its ideal climate and long history of producing some of Japan's sweetest and juiciest mandarin oranges. For locals, mikan are more than just a fruit — they're a symbol of warmth, hospitality, and regional pride. You'll find mikan used in everything from juice and jam to desserts and bath products. Many families even grow their own. When visiting Ehime, it's important to treat mikan with respect: don't waste them, don't scoff at their simplicity, and don't compare them negatively to foreign fruits. Complimenting their flavor, trying different varieties, or learning about mikan farming traditions is a great way to connect with the heart of Ehime's culture — one sweet bite at a time.": "愛媛は「みかん王国」として知られ、みかんは温かさやおもてなし、地域の誇りの象徴です。ジュースやお菓子、入浴剤など様々な形で親しまれています。みかんを粗末にしたり、他国の果物と比べてけなすのは避け、味を褒めたり、栽培の歴史に興味を持つことで、愛媛の心に触れられます。",

    "4. Respect Matsuyama Castle Grounds": "4. 松山城でのマナー",
    "Matsuyama Castle is one of Japan's few surviving original castles and a treasured symbol of Ehime's history and pride. Perched on a hill overlooking the city, the castle grounds are not only a major tourist attraction but also a place of quiet beauty and reflection for locals. Visitors are expected to behave respectfully while exploring the site — that means avoiding loud conversations, rough play, or taking silly or disrespectful selfies near historical structures. Walking carefully, appreciating the architecture, and observing signs and rules help preserve the dignity of this cultural landmark. Treating the castle and its surroundings with reverence not only honors the legacy of the past but also ensures that future generations can enjoy its atmosphere of quiet strength and heritage.": "松山城は現存天守を持つ貴重な城で、愛媛の歴史と誇りの象徴です。観光地であると同時に、地元の人にとっても大切な場所なので、大声やふざけた行動、歴史的建造物の前での不適切な写真撮影は控えましょう。建物や景観を丁寧に楽しみ、ルールを守ることで、未来にもこの雰囲気が残せます。",

    "4. Kagawa": "4. 香川",
    "1. Udon Manners Matter": "1. うどんの食べ方マナー",
    "Kagawa Prefecture is proudly known as the home of Sanuki udon, a thick and chewy noodle that has become a symbol of the region's identity. For locals, udon isn't just a quick meal — it's a carefully crafted dish that reflects centuries of culinary tradition. When dining at udon shops in Kagawa, there are a few unspoken rules to follow. First, don't rush — even though many shops are casual and self-serve, slurping down your bowl without appreciating the flavor and texture is seen as missing the point. Second, avoid over-seasoning — Sanuki udon is known for its subtle balance of flavors, so adding too much soy sauce, chili flakes, or other condiments before tasting is discouraged. Lastly, treat the staff and other diners with quiet courtesy; these shops are often busy, but the atmosphere remains calm and respectful. By enjoying udon the local way, you're not just eating — you're participating in a beloved part of Kagawa's culture.": "香川は讃岐うどんの本場です。地元の人にとってうどんは単なる食事ではなく、伝統と誇りの象徴です。うどん店では、急いで食べず、まずはそのままの味を楽しみ、調味料をかけすぎないのがマナーです。店員や他のお客さんにも静かに配慮し、落ち着いた雰囲気を大切にしましょう。地元流の食べ方を楽しむことで、香川の文化に触れられます。",

    "2. Observe Proper Behavior at Local Markets": "2. 地元市場でのマナー",
    "Local markets in Kagawa, especially in cities like Takamatsu and Marugame, are places where community life and fresh produce meet. While they may seem relaxed and friendly — and they are — there are still important manners to follow. Haggling is generally not practiced, unlike in some other countries. Prices are usually fair and fixed, and trying to bargain can make vendors uncomfortable or even offended. Instead, polite greetings, showing genuine interest in products, and thanking sellers go a long way. It's also important not to block narrow aisles or stand too long in front of stalls without buying, as this can disrupt the flow of customers. Taking photos without asking may also be frowned upon. Visiting these markets with quiet curiosity and respect helps preserve the welcoming atmosphere and supports the hardworking locals who make Kagawa's food culture so special.": "高松や丸亀などの市場は、地元の暮らしと新鮮な食材が集まる場所です。値切り交渉は一般的ではなく、価格はほぼ固定です。挨拶や感謝の言葉、商品への関心を示すことが大切です。通路をふさいだり、長時間立ち止まるのは避けましょう。無断撮影も控え、静かに市場の雰囲気を楽しんでください。",

    "3. Respect Contemporary Art on Naoshima and Teshima": "3. 直島・豊島の現代アートを尊重",
    "Yamaguchi's lantern festivals, especially the Tanabata Lantern Festival, are serene and spiritual events that light up the streets with soft, glowing beauty. During these festivals, thousands of handmade lanterns line roads and temple grounds, creating a peaceful and almost sacred atmosphere. While it's natural to want to take photos, pushing through crowds, using flash, or loudly chatting with friends can disrupt the mood that locals work hard to preserve. These festivals are not loud celebrations — they are moments of reflection, tradition, and quiet beauty. Visitors are encouraged to walk slowly, observe silently, and fully absorb the gentle magic of the lantern-lit night.": "山口の灯籠祭り、特に七夕ちょうちん祭りは、静かで神聖な雰囲気に包まれ、柔らかな灯りが街を幻想的に彩ります。祭りの期間中は、何千もの手作りの灯籠が道路や寺院の境内を美しく照らし、穏やかで神聖な空間が生まれます。写真を撮りたくなる気持ちは自然ですが、人混みを押し分けたり、フラッシュを使ったり、大声で会話したりすると、地元の人々が大切にしている雰囲気を壊してしまいます。これらの祭りは賑やかなイベントではなく、静かに伝統や美しさを感じる時間です。訪れる際は、ゆっくり歩き、静かに観察し、灯籠の優しい光に包まれた夜の幻想的な雰囲気を心から味わいましょう。",

    "4. Show Respect at Ruriko-ji Temple and Mori Clan Sites": "4. 瑠璃光寺や毛利家ゆかりの地を敬意を持って訪れましょう",
    "The islands of Naoshima and Teshima in Kagawa Prefecture are internationally renowned for their stunning blend of nature, architecture, and contemporary art. Home to world-class museums like the Chichu Art Museum and Teshima Art Museum, these islands offer immersive experiences that invite quiet reflection rather than casual tourism. Many of the artworks are designed to interact with light, space, and silence — and touching them, leaning on installations, or taking disruptive selfies can damage both the art and the atmosphere. Photography is restricted in many areas, and rules vary depending on the exhibit. Visitors are expected to move slowly, speak softly, and follow all posted guidelines. Treating these islands not just as photo ops, but as places to truly engage with creativity and thought, reflects the respect these artistic sanctuaries deserve.": "香川県の直島や豊島は、自然と建築、現代アートが融合した世界的な観光地です。美術館や屋外アートは静かに鑑賞し、作品に触れたり、もたれかかったり、騒がしい写真撮影は控えましょう。撮影禁止エリアも多いので、案内表示やルールを守り、静かに芸術と向き合う姿勢が求められます。",
