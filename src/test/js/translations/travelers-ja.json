        "Don't Eat While Walking": "歩きながら食べない",
        "In Japan, you won't see people eating on the streets, as eating while walking is seen as impolite. Whether it's delicious takoyaki or matcha ice cream, finish your snacks at a stall or find a quiet spot. If you take your foods with you, there are no public trash bins on the streets, so littering will be a problem.": "日本では歩きながら食べることはマナー違反とされているため、路上で食事をしている人はほとんど見かけません。たこ焼きや抹茶アイスなども、屋台で食べ終えるか、静かな場所を見つけて食べましょう。持ち歩く場合、街中にゴミ箱が少ないのでゴミの処理にも注意が必要です。",
      
        "Don't Talk on Your Phone on Trains, or in Cafés": "電車やカフェで携帯電話で話さない",
        "Japanese trains and subways are quiet places. Avoid talking on your phone when on a train. On some trains, there are even signs indicating travelers should set their phones to silent mode. If you need to answer a phone call, tell the people that you are on a train and will call back soon. Then, end the call quickly.": "日本の電車や地下鉄はとても静かです。車内での通話は控えましょう。一部の電車ではマナーモードの案内もあります。どうしても電話に出る場合は、電車内にいることを伝えてすぐに切るようにしましょう。",
      
        "Don't Wear Clothes While Soaking in Hot Springs": "温泉で水着を着ない",
        "You are now allowed to wear bathing suits when soaking in Japanese onsens. You need to take off all your clothes and wash thoroughly before entering the baths. If you are too shy to follow this practice, book a private session. Many hotels have rooms with private hot springs, but the prices are very high and they are often very hard to book.": "日本の温泉では水着を着用できません。入浴前にすべての服を脱いで、しっかりと体を洗ってから入りましょう。抵抗がある場合は、貸切風呂の利用もおすすめですが、料金が高く予約も難しいことがあります。",
      
        "Don't Take Photos of Strangers": "見知らぬ人の写真を撮らない",

        "Don't Forget to Take Off Your Shoes When Going Indoors": "室内に入るときは靴を脱ぐ",
        "Tourists visiting Japan need to be aware that wearing shoes inside certain places is something you should never do in Japan. Wearing outdoor shoes is deemed unhygienic by the Japanese so you will be expected to remove your shoes immediately when entering a Japanese home, schools, hospitals and certain restaurants and temples.": "日本では、家や学校、病院、特定のレストランや寺院などに入る際は必ず靴を脱ぎます。外履きのまま入るのは不衛生とされているため、入口で脱ぐのがマナーです。",
      
        "Don't worry though, slippers are always provided. When you enter a building and you see a line of shoes at the entrance, then you know that you will be expected to remove your own.": "ほとんどの場合、スリッパが用意されています。入口に靴が並んでいる場合は、靴を脱ぐ必要があるサインです。",
      
        "For tourists, you will most likely notice this at a traditional Japanese inn, at Japanese restaurants and of course inside shrines and temples. Also, another important rule to note is that you will be expected to exchange your slippers for 'toilet slippers' if you visit the loo. You'll see them at the bathroom door so you can't miss them don't forget to change back when you're finished though!": "伝統的な旅館や日本料理店、神社や寺院でも靴を脱ぐ場面が多いです。また、トイレに入る際は「トイレスリッパ」に履き替えるのがルールです。トイレの前に置いてあるので、使用後は必ず元のスリッパに戻しましょう。",
      
        "Don't Leave A Tip In Japan": "日本ではチップを渡さない",
        "Unlike many other countries around the world, tipping is simply not the done thing in Japan. It's not rude as such but it is definitely not expected. And don't be surprised if you find a waiter/waitress chasing after you if you do leave money on the table It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable with this concept if you come from a country where tipping is prevalent.": "日本ではチップを渡す習慣がありません。失礼にはなりませんが、期待されてもいません。テーブルにお金を置いたままにすると、スタッフが追いかけて返してくることもあります。",
      
        "Simply try to keep in mind that it is just not expected and trying to tip will only lead to confusion. However, there is one exception if you take a tour during your time in Japan, it is always acceptable (but again not expected) to give your tour guide a small tip. Make sure to wrap and fold the tip in paper and politely hand it to your guide using both hands.": "チップは基本的に不要ですが、ツアーガイドなどには心付けとして渡すこともあります。その場合は紙に包み、両手で丁寧に渡しましょう。",
      
        "Wash your entire body before entering the hot springs.": "温泉に入る前に全身を洗う",
        "There will be a shower area with individual faucets with small stools where one can sit and scrub themselves down. After thoroughly showering and rinsing yourself off, rinse down your washing area, including the stool you sat on! Body soap and shampoo are also provided, but you can bring your own if you wish.": "温泉には個別のシャワーや小さな椅子が用意されています。座って体をよく洗い、使った場所や椅子もきれいに流しましょう。ボディソープやシャンプーも備え付けられていますが、持参も可能です。",
