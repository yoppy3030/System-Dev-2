    "Don't Tease or Harass the Deer": "请勿戏弄或骚扰鹿",
    "These seemingly calm and adorable animals can become aggressive if provoked. In recent years, deer-related injuries in Nara have increased as tourists chase the perfect selfie. Many visitors try to attract the deer by offering food, only to pull it away as a joke or use it to pose for photos. Naturally, this frustrates the deer, who may respond by biting or kicking.": "这些看似温顺可爱的鹿被挑逗时也会变得有攻击性。近年来，奈良因游客追求完美自拍而导致的鹿伤人事件增多。许多游客用食物吸引鹿，却又开玩笑地收回或只为拍照而逗弄它们，这让鹿感到沮丧，可能会咬人或踢人。",
    "Wouldn't you be upset if someone promised you food but just pointed a camera at your face instead? On top of that, feeding deer human snacks can make them seriously ill—so be respectful and treat them kindly.": "如果有人答应给你食物却只拿相机对着你，你也会不高兴吧？此外，给鹿喂人类的零食会让它们生病。请尊重并善待鹿。",
    "Don't Feed the Deer Unauthorized Food": "请勿喂食鹿未经许可的食物",
    "Feeding the deer anything other than approved deer crackers (shika senbei) can be harmful to their health. While it might seem harmless to offer them snacks like bread or chips, these foods can upset their digestive system and make them sick.": "除了专用的鹿仙贝外，其他食物都可能对鹿的健康造成伤害。面包、零食等人类食物会导致鹿消化不良甚至生病，请勿随意喂食。",
    "Sadly, some tourists ignore the rules and give deer human food, thinking it's a kind gesture. In reality, it puts the animals at serious risk. If you truly care for the deer, stick to the food provided specifically for them. It's safe, healthy, and helps preserve their well-being.": "遗憾的是，一些游客无视规定，认为给鹿人类食物是好意，但实际上这会让鹿面临严重风险。如果你真的关心鹿，请只喂专用的鹿饼，这样才安全健康，也能保护它们的生命。",
    "Don't Litter in the Park or Temple Areas": "请勿在公园或寺庙区域乱扔垃圾",

Taking pictures is usually fine, but keep a respectful distance and never disturb the surroundings.": "奈良和京都的寺庙、神社和佛像不仅是美丽的地标，更是神圣的文化和宗教象征。请勿随意触摸、攀爬或损坏这些场所。拍照时请保持距离，尊重当地文化和信仰。",

    "The Kansai dialect, or Kansai-ben, is a proud part of the region's identity, especially in places like Osaka and Kyoto. While it may sound different or funny to outsiders, making fun of the accent can come across as disrespectful or offensive. For locals, it's not just a way of speaking—it's a reflection of their culture, humor, and community.": "关西方言是大阪、京都等地文化的重要组成部分。对外地人来说可能听起来有趣，但模仿或嘲笑这种口音会被认为不尊重甚至冒犯。对当地人来说，这不仅仅是语言，更是文化、幽默和社区的体现。",
