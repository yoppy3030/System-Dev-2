        "In Japan, you won't see people eating on the streets, as eating while walking is seen as impolite.

If you take your foods with you, there are no public trash bins on the streets, so littering will be a problem.": "在日本，你不会看到人们在街上吃东西，因为边走边吃被视为不礼貌。无论是美味的章鱼烧还是抹茶冰淇淋，都要在摊位上吃完，或者找一个安静的地方。如果你带着食物，街上没有公共垃圾桶，所以乱扔垃圾会成为一个问题。",

Then, end the call quickly.": "日本的火车和地铁是安静的地方。尽量避免在火车上打电话。在某些火车上，甚至有标志提示旅客将手机设置为静音模式。如果你需要接电话，请告诉对方你在火车上，稍后会回电。然后，迅速结束通话。",

        "For tourists, you will most likely notice this at a traditional Japanese inn, at Japanese restaurants and of course inside shrines and temples. Also, another important rule to note is that you will be expected to exchange your slippers for 'toilet slippers' if you visit the loo. You'll see them at the bathroom door so you can't miss them don't forget to change back when you're finished though!": "对于游客来说，你很可能会在传统的日本旅馆、日本餐厅以及当然在神社和寺庙内部注意到这一点。此外，还有一个重要的规则是，如果你去洗手间，你需要将拖鞋换成“厕所拖鞋”。你会在洗手间门口看到它们，所以你不会错过，但完成后不要忘记换回去！",
        
        "Don't Leave A Tip In Japan": "在日本不要给小费",
        "Unlike many other countries around the world, tipping is simply not the done thing in Japan. It's not rude as such but it is definitely not expected.

        "Simply try to keep in mind that it is just not expected and trying to tip will only lead to confusion. However, there is one exception if you take a tour during your time in Japan, it is always acceptable (but again not expected) to give your tour guide a small tip. Make sure to wrap and fold the tip in paper and politely hand it to your guide using both hands.": "只需记住这并不被期待，试图给小费只会导致混淆。然而，如果你在日本期间参加了一个旅游，给你的导游小费是可以接受的（但同样不被期待）。确保将小费用纸包好并用双手礼貌地递给你的导游。",
