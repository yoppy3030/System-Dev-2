    "Introduction to the Kanto Region": "关东地区介绍",
    "The Kanto region lies in eastern Honshu, Japan's main island, and is home to the country's political, economic, and cultural core. This area includes Tokyo, the bustling capital, as well as other major prefectures like Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma. Known for its dense urban centers, cutting-edge technology, and historical landmarks, Kanto offers a dynamic mix of modern skyscrapers and traditional temples.": "关东地区位于日本本州东部，是日本政治、经济和文化的核心地带。这里不仅有繁华的首都东京，还有神奈川、千叶、埼玉、茨城、栃木和群马等重要县市。关东以其密集的城市中心、尖端科技和历史地标而闻名，现代摩天大楼与传统寺庙在这里完美融合。",
    "From the neon-lit streets of Shibuya and Shinjuku to the serene beauty of Nikko's shrines and Hakone's hot springs, Kanto blends old and new seamlessly. It's also a major transport hub with access to the Shinkansen (bullet train), international airports, and extensive rail networks, making it a popular destination for both locals and travelers.": "从涩谷、新宿的霓虹街道到日光神社和箱根温泉的宁静美景，关东地区将传统与现代完美融合。这里还是重要的交通枢纽，拥有新干线、国际机场和发达的铁路网络，是本地居民和游客都喜欢的目的地。",

    "Kanto region": "关东地区",

    "Tokyo": "东京",
    "1. Stay to the Left (Except in Osaka!)": "1. 靠左站立（大阪除外！）",
    "In Tokyo, one of the unspoken rules that locals naturally follow is to stay to the left when using escalators. This means people stand on the left side so that those in a hurry can walk up or down on the right. It's a small but important part of the city's fast-paced daily life, especially in crowded train stations.": "在东京，使用自动扶梯时靠左站立是大家自觉遵守的不成文规定。人们站在左侧，让赶时间的人可以从右侧通行。这是快节奏城市生活中的重要细节，尤其是在拥挤的车站里。",
    "Interestingly, this rule is not the same throughout Japan—for example, in Osaka, people do the opposite and stand on the right side, allowing others to pass on the left. Knowing which side to stand on may seem like a small detail, but it shows respect for others and helps keep things moving smoothly in busy areas.": "有趣的是，这个规则在日本各地并不相同。比如在大阪，人们会靠右站立，让左侧通行。了解应该站在哪一侧虽然是小细节，但体现了对他人的尊重，也有助于在繁忙场所保持秩序。",

    "2. Avoid Eating While Walking": "2. 避免边走边吃",
    "In Tokyo, it's considered good manners to avoid eating while walking. While it might seem normal in other countries, locals in Tokyo usually eat their food near the shop where they bought it or wait until they find a proper place to sit. This habit helps keep the streets clean and shows respect to others around you.": "在东京，边走边吃被认为是不礼貌的行为。虽然这在其他国家可能很常见，但东京人通常会在购买食物的店铺附近或找到合适的座位后再享用。这种习惯有助于保持街道整洁，也体现了对他人的尊重。",
    "Eating on the go, especially in crowded areas, can be seen as careless or even rude. That's why you'll often see people standing beside food stalls or using benches in parks to enjoy their meals properly.": "边走边吃，特别是在拥挤的地方，会被认为不够体面甚至无礼。因此你经常能看到人们站在小吃摊旁或坐在公园长椅上好好享用食物。",

    "3. Queueing Culture": "3. 排队文化",
    "In Tokyo, orderly queueing is an unspoken rule that everyone follows without exception. Whether you're waiting for a train, lining up at a popular restaurant, or boarding a bus, locals always form neat, single-file lines and patiently wait their turn. Jumping ahead or cutting in line is considered extremely rude and can draw disapproving looks or even polite reminders from those around you. This respect for order helps keep public spaces calm and efficient, especially during busy rush hours when crowds are large. Even at crowded places, people quietly accept the wait, valuing fairness and harmony over impatience. This culture of disciplined queuing reflects the broader social emphasis on respect and consideration that Tokyoites live by every day..": "在东京，有序排队是大家严格遵守的不成文规定。无论是等电车、在热门餐厅排队还是乘坐公交车，人们都会自觉地排成一列，耐心等待。插队被认为极其无礼，可能会引来周围人不满的目光或礼貌的提醒。这种对秩序的尊重让公共场所保持安静高效，特别是在人流密集的高峰时段。即使在拥挤的地方，人们也会安静地等待，重视公平与和谐胜过急躁。这种有纪律的排队文化体现了东京人日常生活中对尊重和体贴的重视。",

    "Chiba": "千叶",
    "1. Beach & Coastal Etiquette": "1. 海滩与海岸礼仪",
    "In Chiba, where beaches and coastal areas are a big part of everyday life, locals follow strict etiquette that differs from the more urban Tokyo lifestyle. Visitors and residents alike are careful never to leave trash behind, respecting the natural beauty of the coastline.": "在千叶，海滩和海岸是日常生活的重要组成部分，当地人遵守严格的礼仪规范，这与东京的都市生活方式有所不同。无论是游客还是居民，都会注意不留下垃圾，尊重海岸线的自然美景。",
    "Swimming is only allowed within designated safe zones, and lifeguards closely enforce these boundaries to prevent accidents. Unlike in Tokyo, where rivers or small parks are more common spots for relaxation, Chiba's beach culture emphasizes safety, cleanliness, and consideration for others, especially during the busy summer months when the beaches fill up. This careful respect for the environment and safety rules reflects the strong connection locals have with their coastal surroundings.": "游泳只能在指定的安全区域进行，救生员会严格管理这些区域以防止意外发生。与东京常见的河流或小公园不同，千叶的海滩文化强调安全、清洁和对他人的体贴，特别是在夏季海滩人满为患的时候。这种对环境和安全规则的谨慎尊重体现了当地人与海岸环境的紧密联系。",

    "2. Farmers' Market Bargaining Is Okay": "2. 农贸市场可以讨价还价",
    "In Chiba's more rural and agricultural communities, visiting farmers' markets or roadside stalls often comes with a unique cultural twist that's quite different from Tokyo's more formal shopping scene. It's generally accepted—and even expected—to engage in polite bargaining or price negotiations with vendors, especially when buying in bulk or at smaller, family-run stalls.": "在千叶的农村和农业社区，逛农贸市场或路边摊时，往往会有独特的文化特色，这与东京更正式的购物场景很不一样。礼貌地讨价还价或与商贩协商价格是普遍接受甚至期望的行为，特别是在批量购买或在家庭经营的小摊上。",
    "This friendly back-and-forth reflects the close relationships between locals and producers, and it's seen as part of the shopping experience rather than rude or confrontational. In contrast, Tokyo's markets tend to have fixed prices, and bargaining is rarely practiced, making this a distinctive and authentic local custom in Chiba.": "这种友好的讨价还价反映了当地人与生产者之间的密切关系，被视为购物体验的一部分，而不是无礼或对抗行为。相比之下，东京的市场通常有固定价格，很少讨价还价，这使得这成为千叶独特而真实的地方风俗。",

    "3. Respect for Local Festivals (Matsuri) with Unique Traditions": "3. 尊重独特传统的地方祭典",
    "Chiba hosts many local festivals with traditions specific to small towns and fishing communities. Locals strictly follow rituals or dress codes for these festivals, like wearing specific happi coats or carrying mikoshi (portable shrines) in a certain way. Outsiders who join are expected to learn and respect these traditions deeply, more so than the bigger, tourist-oriented festivals in Tokyo.": "千叶举办许多具有小镇和渔村独特传统的地方祭典。当地人会严格遵守这些祭典的仪式或着装规定，比如穿特定的法被或以特定方式抬神轿。外来者参加时需要深入学习和尊重这些传统，这比东京的大型旅游导向祭典要求更严格。",

    "4. No Late-Night Noise in Residential Areas": "4. 住宅区夜间禁止喧哗",
    "In Chiba's residential and suburban neighborhoods, there is a strong local expectation to keep noise levels very low, especially late at night. Unlike Tokyo's busy entertainment districts where nightlife can continue until the early hours, many parts of Chiba value quiet and peaceful evenings. Making loud noises, playing music, or having rowdy gatherings after 9 or 10 p.m. is generally frowned upon and can quickly lead to complaints from neighbors. This respect for quiet hours helps maintain the calm, close-knit community atmosphere that many residents cherish. Visitors and newcomers are expected to be mindful of this unwritten rule to avoid disturbing the neighborhood harmony.": "在千叶的住宅区和郊区，当地人有强烈的期望保持很低的噪音水平，特别是在深夜。与东京热闹的娱乐区夜生活可以持续到凌晨不同，千叶的许多地方重视安静和平和的夜晚。晚上9点或10点后制造噪音、播放音乐或举行喧闹的聚会通常会被认为不妥，并可能很快招致邻居的投诉。这种对安静时间的尊重有助于维持许多居民珍视的平静、紧密的社区氛围。访客和新居民应该注意这个不成文的规定，以避免扰乱邻里和谐。",

    "Kanagawa": "神奈川",
    "1. Respect for Shrine and Temple Parking Customs": "1. 遵守神社和寺庙的停车习惯",
    "In Kanagawa towns like Kamakura, shrine and temple parking often follows unwritten local rules. Some spots are informally reserved for regular worshippers or locals, even if no signs are posted. Parking there without knowing the custom can be seen as rude. Unlike Tokyo's clearly marked lots or Chiba's open rural areas, Kanagawa requires a bit more local awareness and quiet respect.": "在神奈川的镰仓等城镇，神社和寺庙的停车场通常遵循不成文的当地规则。有些车位虽然没有标识，但实际上是为常客或当地人保留的。不了解这些习惯就停车会被认为不礼貌。与东京明确标识的停车场或千叶开放的农村地区不同，神奈川需要更多的当地意识和安静的尊重。",

    "2. Quiet Onsen (Hot Spring) Behavior": "2. 安静的温泉礼仪",
    "In Kanagawa, especially in famous hot spring areas like Hakone, locals observe very strict and respectful onsen etiquette that often surprises visitors. Kanagawa's hot springs require guests to maintain complete silence or speak in very low voices to preserve a peaceful atmosphere. Tattoos are generally not allowed, reflecting a cultural sensitivity that's still strongly upheld by local bathhouses. Additionally, it's considered improper to enter the baths immediately after eating or drinking alcohol, as this can be harmful to your health and disrespectful to the tradition.": "在神奈川，特别是在箱根等著名温泉地，当地人遵守非常严格和尊重的温泉礼仪，这常常让游客感到惊讶。神奈川的温泉要求客人保持完全安静或非常低声地说话，以保持宁静的氛围。通常不允许有纹身，这反映了当地澡堂仍然强烈坚持的文化敏感性。此外，刚吃完饭或饮酒后立即入浴被认为是不合适的，因为这可能对健康有害，也是对传统的不尊重。",

    "These detailed rules ensure the onsen experience remains calming and restorative for everyone, and locals take them very seriously.In Kanagawa, especially in famous hot spring areas like Hakone, locals observe very strict and respectful onsen etiquette that often surprises visitors. Unlike in Tokyo or Chiba, where public bathhouse rules can be a bit more relaxed, Kanagawa's hot springs require guests to maintain complete silence or speak in very low voices to preserve a peaceful atmosphere.": "这些详细的规则确保温泉体验对每个人来说都是平静和恢复性的，当地人非常认真地遵守这些规则。在神奈川，特别是在箱根等著名温泉地，当地人遵守非常严格和尊重的温泉礼仪，这常常让游客感到惊讶。与东京或千叶的公共澡堂规则可能稍微宽松不同，神奈川的温泉要求客人保持完全安静或非常低声地说话，以保持宁静的氛围。",

    "Tattoos are generally not allowed, reflecting a cultural sensitivity that's still strongly upheld by local bathhouses. Additionally, it's considered improper to enter the baths immediately after eating or drinking alcohol, as this can be harmful to your health and disrespectful to the tradition. These detailed rules ensure the onsen experience remains calming and restorative for everyone, and locals take them very seriously.": "通常不允许有纹身，这反映了当地澡堂仍然强烈坚持的文化敏感性。此外，刚吃完饭或饮酒后立即入浴被认为是不合适的，因为这可能对健康有害，也是对传统的不尊重。这些详细的规则确保温泉体验对每个人来说都是平静和恢复性的，当地人非常认真地遵守这些规则。",

    "3. No Umbrella Sharing in Crowded Areas": "3. 拒绝在拥挤场所共用雨伞",
    "In Kanagawa, particularly in urban areas like Yokohama and around busy train stations, there's an unspoken rule among locals to avoid sharing umbrellas with strangers in crowded places, even during sudden heavy rain. Unlike in Tokyo, where people may sometimes casually huddle under someone else's umbrella when packed together, or in Chiba where people tend to stick to personal umbrellas due to open spaces, Kanagawa locals value personal space and privacy even in tight spots.": "在神奈川，特别是在横滨等城市地区和繁忙的车站周围，当地人有不成文的规定，即使在突然下大雨时也要避免在拥挤的地方与陌生人共用雨伞。与东京人有时会在拥挤时随意挤在别人的伞下，或千叶人由于开放空间而倾向于使用个人雨伞不同，神奈川人即使在拥挤的地方也重视个人空间和隐私。",

    "Reaching under someone's umbrella or trying to share without permission is seen as intrusive and uncomfortable. Most locals carry compact umbrellas to avoid this situation altogether, reflecting a subtle but important aspect of personal boundary awareness in the area.": "试图进入别人的伞下或未经许可试图共用雨伞被视为侵入性和令人不适的行为。大多数当地人携带紧凑型雨伞来完全避免这种情况，这反映了该地区对个人边界意识的微妙但重要的方面。",

    "4. Respect for Coastal Fishing Zones": "4. 遵守沿海渔业区域规定",
    "Along Kanagawa's coastal areas, especially on the Miura Peninsula and in fishing towns like Hayama or Yokosuka, locals observe strict respect for designated fishing zones. These areas are often marked, but even when they aren't, local people know which spots are reserved for professional or community use. Fishing in these restricted zones—especially early in the morning or near docks—without understanding the local customs can lead to polite but firm requests to leave.": "在神奈川的沿海地区，特别是在三浦半岛和叶山、横须贺等渔镇，当地人严格遵守指定的渔业区域。这些区域通常有标记，但即使没有标记，当地人也知道哪些地方是为专业或社区使用保留的。在不了解当地习俗的情况下在这些限制区域钓鱼——特别是在清晨或码头附近——可能会导致礼貌但坚决的离开请求。",
    
    "Unlike the more recreational beach areas in Chiba or the urban waterfronts in Tokyo, Kanagawa's fishing zones are often tied to long-standing traditions and livelihoods. Locals take these boundaries seriously, and respecting them is seen as a sign of good manners and awareness of the community's way of life.": "与千叶更多的休闲海滩区域或东京的城市海滨不同，神奈川的渔业区域通常与长期传统和生计联系在一起。当地人认真对待这些界限，尊重它们被视为良好礼仪和对社区生活方式认识的标志。",

    "Saitama": "埼玉",
    "1. Riverbank Respect": "1. 尊重河岸环境",
    "In Saitama, riverbanks along places like the Arakawa and Shingashi rivers are popular spots for seasonal activities such as hanami (cherry blossom viewing) and fireworks festivals.": "在埼玉，荒川、新河岸川等河岸是赏樱、看烟花等季节活动的热门场所。",

    "Locals take great care to keep these natural areas clean and beautiful by following a strict unspoken rule: always clean up completely after gatherings. People often bring their own garbage bags and make sure to pick up any litter, even if it isn't theirs. Leaving trash behind is considered highly disrespectful and can lead to disapproval from the community. This strong sense of responsibility helps preserve the peaceful environment and ensures that everyone can continue to enjoy these riverside spaces year after year.": "当地人非常注意保持这些自然区域的清洁和美丽，遵循严格的潜规则：聚会后必须完全清理。人们经常自带垃圾袋，确保捡起任何垃圾，即使不是自己的。留下垃圾被认为极不尊重，可能导致社区的反对。这种强烈的责任感有助于保护和平的环境，确保每个人都能年复一年地享受这些河滨空间。",

    "2. Silent Commuting Culture on Suburban Trains": "2. 郊区电车上的安静通勤文化",
    "Saitama commuters are known for being extra quiet and reserved on trains, even compared to Tokyo. Locals often avoid eye contact, don't speak unless necessary, and rarely use phones aloud—even in casual situations. It's part of the calm suburban culture.": "埼玉的通勤者以在电车上特别安静和保守而闻名，甚至比东京还要安静。当地人通常避免眼神接触，除非必要否则不说话，很少大声使用手机——即使在随意的情况下也是如此。这是平静郊区文化的一部分。",

    "3. No Flashy Fashion in Local Malls": "3. 商场内避免穿着过于花哨",
    "In suburban areas of Saitama, especially in smaller cities and towns, locals tend to dress casually and modestly. Wearing flashy or high-end Tokyo-style fashion in local malls or supermarkets can draw quiet stares or make you stand out awkwardly. While not offensive, it goes against the area's more relaxed and down-to-earth vibe, where blending in is preferred.": "在埼玉的郊区，特别是在较小的城市和城镇，当地人倾向于穿着随意和朴素。在当地的商场或超市穿着花哨或高端东京风格时尚可能会引来安静的注视或让你显得格格不入。虽然不冒犯，但它违背了该地区更放松和朴实的氛围，在那里融入是首选。",
