    "Introduction to the Kyushu & Okinawa Region": "九州与冲绳地区简介",
    "Kyushu & Okinawa region": "九州与冲绳地区",
    "Located in the southwest of Japan, Kyushu and Okinawa offer a vibrant contrast to the country's more urbanized regions. Kyushu, Japan's third-largest island, is known for its dramatic volcanoes, historic samurai towns, hot spring resorts, and rich culinary traditions.": "九州和冲绳位于日本西南部，与该国其他高度城市化的地区形成了鲜明的对比。九州是日本第三大岛，以其壮观的火山、历史悠久的武士城镇、温泉度假村和丰富的饮食文化而闻名。",
    "With seven diverse prefectures — including Fukuoka, Kumamoto, and Nagasaki — Kyushu blends modern innovation with deep cultural roots, such as yatai street food, active volcanoes like Mt. Aso, and Christian heritage sites. Just to the south, the Okinawa Islands form a tropical chain with a unique identity influenced by their history as the Ryukyu Kingdom. Okinawa is famous for its emerald beaches, distinctive music and dance, and one of the world's longest-living populations. Together, Kyushu and Okinawa offer a deeply local, welcoming, and unforgettable side of Japan far from the big cities.": "九州拥有福冈、熊本和长崎等七个各具特色的县，融合了现代创新与深厚的文化根基，例如\"屋台\"街头小吃、阿苏山等活火山以及基督教遗产地。在其南部，冲绳群岛构成了一个热带岛链，其独特的身份深受其作为琉球王国历史的影响。冲绳以其翠绿的海滩、独特的音乐和舞蹈，以及世界上最长寿的人口之一而闻名。九州和冲绳共同展现了远离大城市、充满地方特色、热情好客且令人难忘的日本风情。",

    "1. Fukuoka": "1. 福冈",
    "1. Don't Stay Too Long at Yatai (Street Food Stalls)": "1. 不要在\"屋台\"（街头小吃摊）逗留太久",
    "Yatai, or street food stalls, are one of Fukuoka's most beloved cultural experiences, offering warm food and friendly conversation in a small, casual setting. However, seating is limited and turnover is important — these stalls are designed for quick, social meals, not long dinners. After enjoying your food and perhaps a short chat, it's polite to make space for others waiting to sit. Lingering too long, especially during busy evening hours, can unintentionally inconvenience both the stall owner and other customers. Being mindful of your time at the yatai helps keep this special tradition alive and welcoming for everyone.": "“屋台”是福冈最受欢迎的文化体验之一，在小巧随意的环境中提供热腾腾的食物和友好的交谈。然而，座位有限，周转率很重要——这些摊位是为快速、社交性的用餐而设计的，而非长时间的晚餐。享用完食物并进行了简短交谈后，为等待的其他人让出空间是礼貌的做法。逗留太久，尤其是在繁忙的夜晚时段，可能会无意中给摊主和其他顾客带来不便。注意您在屋台的时间，有助于保持这一特殊传统的活力，并使其对每个人都友好。",

    "2. Don't Eat or Drink Around Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine Grounds": "2. 不要在太宰府天满宫内饮食",
    "Dazaifu Tenmangu is one of Fukuoka's most important and sacred shrines, dedicated to the deity of learning, Sugawara no Michizane. While the approach to the shrine is lined with lively shops selling sweets and souvenirs — including the famous ume mochi rice cakes — once you pass through the torii gate, it's important to shift your behavior. Eating or drinking inside the shrine grounds is considered disrespectful, as the area is a place for prayer, reflection, and quiet. Be sure to finish any snacks or drinks before entering, and always bow respectfully when passing through sacred spaces. Keeping this etiquette helps preserve the solemn atmosphere that worshippers and locals deeply value.": "太宰府天满宫是福冈最重要和最神圣的神社之一，供奉着学问之神菅原道真。虽然通往神社的参道上排列着售卖甜点和纪念品的热闹商店——包括著名的\"梅枝饼\"——但一旦穿过鸟居，就必须改变您的行为。在神社内饮食被认为是不敬的，因为这里是祈祷、反思和安静的场所。请务必在进入前吃完任何零食或喝完饮料，并在穿过神圣空间时恭敬地鞠躬。遵守这一礼仪有助于维护信徒和当地人深为珍视的庄严氛围。",

    "3. Don't Imitate or Interrupt Hakata Gion Yamakasa Participants": "3. 不要模仿或打扰博多祇园山笠的参与者",
    "The Hakata Gion Yamakasa is one of Fukuoka's most iconic and sacred festivals, held every July for over 770 years. During this event, teams of men dressed in traditional attire carry massive wooden floats and race through the streets of Hakata in a powerful display of teamwork, speed, and devotion. While tourists are encouraged to watch and enjoy, it's important to respect the spiritual and cultural significance of the event. Never try to join the runners, mimic their actions, or step into their path for photos. Doing so not only disrupts the flow of the procession but also shows disrespect toward the local community that trains and prepares all year for this festival. Enjoy the energy from a safe distance and honor the tradition by observing quietly and respectfully.": "博多祇园山笠是福冈最具代表性和最神圣的节日之一，每年七月举行，已有770多年的历史。在此期间，身着传统服装的男人们抬着巨大的木制花车，在博多的街道上飞奔，这是团队合作、速度和奉献精神的有力展示。虽然鼓励游客观看和享受，但尊重这一活动的宗教和文化意义至关重要。切勿试图加入奔跑者、模仿他们的行为或为拍照而挡住他们的去路。这样做不仅会扰乱游行的进程，也表现出对为这个节日训练和准备了一整年的当地社区的不尊重。请从安全距离欣赏其活力，并通过安静恭敬地观察来尊重传统。",

    "4. Don't Confuse Mentaiko with Common Spicy Paste": "4. 不要将明太子与普通的辣酱混淆",
    "In Fukuoka, mentaiko — spicy cod roe — is more than just a condiment; it's a beloved local delicacy with a deep cultural identity. Unlike generic spicy sauces or pastes, Fukuoka's mentaiko is carefully marinated in a secret blend of chili, sake, and seasonings, with each shop offering its own unique flavor profile. Tourists sometimes mistake it for just another \"spicy spread,\" but doing so overlooks its richness, subtle heat, and importance in Hakata cuisine. Whether it's served with rice, in pasta, or even on baguettes, mentaiko is meant to be appreciated like fine cheese or artisan miso — not dismissed as something ordinary. Trying it with an open mind shows respect for local food culture and the generations of craftsmanship behind each bite.": "在福冈，明太子——辣味鳕鱼子——不仅仅是一种调味品；它是一种深受喜爱的当地美食，具有深厚的文化认同。与普通的辣酱或酱料不同，福冈的明太子是用辣椒、清酒和调味料的秘制配方精心腌制的，每家店都有其独特的风味。游客有时会误以为它只是一种\"辣味抹酱\"，但这样做忽略了它的丰富性、微妙的辣味以及在博多料理中的重要性。无论是配米饭、意面，还是放在法棍面包上，明太子都应该像品尝优质奶酪或手工味噌一样来欣赏——而不是被当作普通的东西。以开放的心态尝试，是对当地饮食文化和每一口背后世代相传的工艺的尊重。",

    "2. Oita": "2. 大分",
    "1.Don't Treat Onsen Like Pools or Spas": "1. 不要像对待游泳池或水疗中心那样对待温泉",
    "Ōita, especially cities like Beppu and Yufuin, is famous for its incredible variety of hot springs — but these are not the same as Western-style spas or swimming pools. For locals, onsen are places of healing, relaxation, and tradition, and they come with long-established etiquette. Visitors should never splash, swim, or dive into the water. Before entering, you must wash and rinse your body thoroughly at the provided shower area. Towels should never go into the bath itself — leave them on the side or place a small towel on your head. Speaking quietly is also expected, and using phones or taking photos is usually forbidden. Respecting these customs ensures that everyone — locals and tourists — can enjoy the peaceful onsen experience together.": "大分县，特别是别府和由布院等城市，以其种类繁多的温泉而闻名——但这些与西式的水疗中心或游泳池不同。对当地人来说，温泉是疗愈、放松和传统的地方，并有其悠久的礼仪。游客切勿泼水、游泳或跳入水中。进入浴池前，必须在指定的淋浴区彻底清洗身体。毛巾绝不能放入浴池中——应放在旁边或将小毛巾放在头上。说话也应保持安静，通常禁止使用手机或拍照。尊重这些习俗，确保每个人——无论是当地人还是游客——都能共同享受宁静的温泉体验。",

    "2. Don't Be Surprised by Mixed-Gender Baths": "2. 不要对男女混浴感到惊讶",
    "In some rural areas of Ōita Prefecture, especially in traditional or historic hot springs, you may encounter mixed-gender baths, known as konyoku (混浴). While uncommon in most parts of Japan today, konyoku is still practiced in certain regions of Ōita where it's seen as part of the local culture, not something strange or inappropriate. These baths often have modesty rules — such as towels, bathing wear, or gender-separated times — but the atmosphere remains relaxed and respectful. If you're uncomfortable, simply ask the staff if there's a private or gender-specific option available. Most importantly, avoid reacting loudly, laughing, or staring — treating the experience with quiet respect honors the traditions of the local community": "在大分县的一些乡村地区，特别是在传统或历史悠久的温泉中，您可能会遇到男女混浴，即\"konyoku\"（混浴）。虽然在今天的日本大部分地区已不常见，但在大分的某些地区，混浴仍然存在，并被视为当地文化的一部分，而非奇怪或不恰当的事情。这些浴场通常有关于遮挡身体的规定——例如使用毛巾、穿着浴衣或分男女入浴时间——但气氛仍然是轻松和尊重的。如果您感到不自在，只需询问工作人员是否有私人或分性别的选择。最重要的是，避免大声反应、嘲笑或盯着看——以安静和尊重的方式体验，是对当地社区传统的尊重。",

    "3. Don't Touch Bamboo Crafts Without Permission": "3. 未经许可不要触摸竹工艺品",
    "Ōita, especially Beppu, is renowned for its traditional bamboo craftsmanship, with finely woven baskets, trays, and decorative items that often take days or even weeks to create by hand. These crafts are not mass-produced souvenirs — they are delicate works of art that reflect generations of skill and care. When visiting bamboo craft shops, galleries, or exhibitions, it's important to look with your eyes, not your hands, unless signs say it's okay. Many items are fragile or made for display only, and touching without permission could damage them or be considered disrespectful. If you're interested in a piece, politely ask the staff for help — they'll usually be happy to show it to you properly.": "大分，特别是别府，以其传统的竹工艺而闻名，那些精细编织的篮子、托盘和装饰品通常需要工匠花费数天甚至数周的时间手工制作。这些工艺品不是批量生产的纪念品——它们是反映了世代相传的技艺和心血的精致艺术品。在参观竹工艺品店、画廊或展览时，除非有标志说明可以触摸，否则请用眼睛欣赏，而不是用手。许多物品都很脆弱或是仅供展示，未经许可触摸可能会损坏它们或被认为是不尊重的。如果您对某件作品感兴趣，请礼貌地向工作人员求助——他们通常会很乐意为您展示。",

    "4. Don't Take Photos Inside Onsen Facilities": "4. 不要在温泉设施内拍照",
    "In Ōita's famous onsen towns like Beppu and Yufuin, photography inside bathing areas is strictly discouraged — and often outright prohibited. Onsen are places of privacy, relaxation, and personal comfort, and taking photos can make other guests feel uncomfortable or exposed, especially since everyone is bathing nude. Even in outdoor baths or scenic hot spring areas, if people are present, it's best to avoid using cameras or smartphones altogether. Some sightseeing spots, like the \"hells\" (jigoku), allow photos — but bathing areas do not. Always check for signs, and when in doubt, ask staff. Respecting others' privacy helps preserve the calm, welcoming spirit of the onsen experience.": "在别府和由布院等大分著名的温泉镇，浴场内的摄影是严格禁止的。温泉是注重隐私、放松和个人舒适的地方，拍照可能会让其他客人感到不舒服或暴露，特别是因为大家都是裸体沐浴。即使在露天浴池或风景优美的温泉区，如果有人在场，最好也完全避免使用相机或智能手机。\"地狱巡礼\"等一些观光景点允许拍照——但浴场不允许。请务必检查标志，如有疑问，请询问工作人员。尊重他人的隐私有助于维护温泉体验的平静和热情的精神。",

    "5. Don't Waste Local Foods Like Toriten or Dangojiru": "5. 不要浪费像\"鸡肉天妇罗\"或\"团子汤\"这样的当地食物",
    "Ōita is proud of its regional dishes like toriten (crispy chicken tempura) and dangojiru (miso soup with hand-rolled dumplings and vegetables), both rooted in local home cooking and tradition. These meals are more than just food — they represent the heart of Ōita's culinary identity. When dining in local restaurants or inns, it's considered respectful to finish what you're served, or at least try most of it. Leaving food uneaten, especially after showing strong curiosity to try it, may come across as wasteful or impolite. If you're unsure about the portion size or flavor, it's best to order small and add more later. Showing appreciation — even with a simple \"gochisousama deshita\" after the meal — goes a long way in honoring local hospitality.": "大分为其地方菜肴如\"toriten\"（酥脆的鸡肉天妇罗）和\"dangojiru\"（带手擀面团和蔬菜的味噌汤）而自豪，这两道菜都植根于当地的家常烹饪和传统。这些餐点不仅仅是食物——它们代表了大分饮食文化的精髓。在当地餐厅或旅馆用餐时，吃完所点的食物，或至少尝试大部分，被认为是尊重的表现。留下未吃的食物，尤其是在表现出强烈的好奇心之后，可能会被视为浪费或不礼貌。如果您不确定份量或口味，最好先点少量，然后再加。饭后简单地说一句\"gochisousama deshita\"（多谢款待），在尊重当地人的热情好客方面大有裨益。",

    "3. Okinawa": "3. 冲绳",
    "1.Don't Ignore Umbrella Etiquette on Rainy Days": "1.不要忘记冲绳独特的琉球文化",
    "Okinawa may be part of Japan today, but it was once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom with its own language, culture, and traditions. This unique heritage is still deeply felt by the local people. Assuming that Okinawa is culturally identical to mainland Japan — or treating it like just another tropical tourist spot — can come off as ignorant or disrespectful. Locals are proud of their distinct identity, which blends Ryukyuan roots with a mix of Japanese and American influences. Visitors who take the time to learn about Okinawa's history, listen to its music, taste its traditional food, and appreciate its differences are warmly welcomed. Showing curiosity and respect goes a long way in connecting with the Okinawan spirit.": "冲绳今天可能是日本的一部分，但它曾经是一个拥有自己语言、文化和传统的独立琉球王国。这种独特的遗产至今仍被当地人民深刻地感受到。假设冲绳在文化上与日本本土完全相同——或将其视为又一个热带旅游景点——可能会显得无知或不尊重。当地人为他们独特的身份感到自豪，这种身份融合了琉球的根源以及日本和美国的影响。花时间了解冲绳的历史、聆听其音乐、品尝其传统食物并欣赏其差异的游客会受到热烈欢迎。表现出好奇心和尊重，是与冲绳精神建立联系的重要一步。",

    "2. Show Respect When Drinking Awamori": "2. 饮用泡盛时要表示尊重",
    "Awamori is Okinawa's traditional distilled liquor, made from long-grain Thai rice and aged in clay pots for a smooth, rich flavor. It's more than just a drink — it's a cultural symbol often shared during celebrations, family gatherings, and even spiritual rituals. When offered awamori, it's polite to receive it with both hands and return the gesture by pouring for others. Chugging it like a shot or treating it as a party drink can be seen as disrespectful, especially in more traditional settings. Locals value the slow, social nature of drinking — it's about connection, not speed. Savoring awamori and honoring the custom of mutual hospitality reflects genuine appreciation for Okinawan culture.": "泡盛是冲绳的传统蒸馏酒，由长粒泰国米制成，并在陶罐中陈酿，口感顺滑、风味浓郁。它不仅仅是一种饮料——它是一种文化象征，常在庆祝活动、家庭聚会甚至宗教仪式中分享。当有人为您倒泡盛时，礼貌的做法是双手接过，并为他人倒酒以示回敬。像喝烈酒一样一饮而尽，或将其视为派对饮料，可能会被认为是不尊重的，尤其是在更传统的场合。当地人重视缓慢、社交性的饮酒方式——关键在于联系，而不是速度。品味泡盛并尊重相互款待的习俗，体现了对冲绳文化的真正欣赏。",

    "3. Don't Walk on Sacred Utaki Sites": "3. 不要在神圣的\"御岳\"遗址上行走",
    "In Okinawa, utaki are sacred sites deeply connected to the island's indigenous Ryukyuan spirituality. These places — often groves, caves, or stone formations — are considered dwellings of gods and ancestral spirits. Many utaki are still actively used for prayer and rituals, especially by local women known as noro (priestesses). Tourists may come across these sites in forests, near beaches, or even along hiking trails. While they may look like natural landmarks, stepping into them, touching altars, or taking casual photos can be seen as highly disrespectful. When in doubt, observe from a distance and follow local signs or guidance. Showing reverence to these quiet spiritual spaces reflects true respect for Okinawa's living traditions.": "在冲绳，\"御岳\"（utaki）是与岛上土著琉球精神信仰深切相关的神圣场所。这些地方——通常是树林、洞穴或岩石构造——被认为是神灵和祖先灵魂的居所。许多御岳至今仍被积极用于祈祷和仪式，特别是被当地称为\"noro\"（祝女）的女性。游客可能会在森林、海滩附近甚至徒步小径上遇到这些地方。虽然它们可能看起来像自然地标，但踏入其中、触摸祭坛或随意拍照可能被视为极不尊重。如有疑问，请从远处观察并遵循当地标志或指导。对这些宁静的精神空间表示敬畏，体现了对冲绳活态传统的真正尊重。",

    "4. Be Sensitive About War History": "4. 对战争历史保持敏感",
    "Okinawa was the site of one of the most devastating battles of World War II, and the scars of that conflict are still deeply felt by its people. The Battle of Okinawa claimed over 200,000 lives — including many civilians — and left lasting trauma on the island. Today, places like the Okinawa Peace Memorial Park, Himeyuri Monument, and Former Japanese Navy Underground Headquarters stand as solemn reminders of that tragedy. Visitors are expected to approach these sites with quiet respect and reflection. Making jokes, taking cheerful selfies, or making light comments about war or the U.S. military presence can deeply offend locals. Understanding the pain and resilience behind Okinawa's peace message is key to appreciating the island beyond its beaches and beauty.": "冲绳是第二次世界大战中最具毁灭性的战役之一的发生地，那场冲突的创伤至今仍被其人民深刻地感受到。冲绳战役夺去了超过20万人的生命——包括许多平民——并在岛上留下了持久的创伤。今天，像冲绳和平纪念公园、姬百合之塔和前海军司令部壕等地方，都作为那场悲剧的庄严提醒而存在。游客应以安静的尊重和反思的态度来参观这些地方。开玩笑、拍欢乐的自拍照，或对战争或美军存在发表轻率的评论，都可能深深冒犯当地人。理解冲绳和平信息背后的痛苦和坚韧，是超越其海滩和美景来欣赏这个岛屿的关键。",

    "4. Miyazaki": "4. 宫崎",
    "1. Respect for Shinto Mythology Sites": "1. 尊重神道神话遗址",
    "Miyazaki is deeply connected to the roots of Japanese mythology, with sacred locations like Takachiho Gorge, Amano-Iwato Shrine, and Udo Shrine tied to ancient legends about the gods, including the sun goddess Amaterasu. These aren't just sightseeing spots — they are spiritual places where locals come to pray, reflect, and honor their cultural heritage. Visitors should remain quiet, avoid disruptive behavior, and dress modestly when visiting these sites. Taking loud selfies, ignoring shrine etiquette (like bowing or washing hands), or treating the myths as mere folklore can come across as disrespectful. Understanding and honoring the spiritual meaning behind these places allows for a much deeper and more respectful connection to Miyazaki's cultural soul.": "宫崎与日本神话的根源紧密相连，像高千穗峡、天岩户神社和鹈户神宫等圣地都与古代关于众神（包括太阳女神天照大神）的传说有关。这些不仅仅是观光景点——它们是当地人前来祈祷、反思和尊崇其文化遗产的精神场所。游客在参观这些地方时应保持安静，避免干扰行为，并穿着得体。大声自拍、无视神社礼仪（如鞠躬或洗手），或将神话视为纯粹的民间故事，都可能被认为是不尊重的。理解并尊重这些地方背后的精神意义，可以与宫崎的文化灵魂建立更深、更尊重的联系。",

    "2. Surfing with Aloha Spirit": "2. 以\"阿罗哈精神\"冲浪",
    "Miyazaki is a renowned surfing destination, celebrated for its scenic beaches and perfect waves. However, surfing here is not just about riding waves — it's about embracing the Aloha spirit, which emphasizes respect, humility, and community. When visiting local surf spots, such as Aoshima Beach or Kushima, it's important to follow surf etiquette. This includes waiting your turn, respecting local surfers, and avoiding aggressive behavior in the water. The vibe is laid-back, with an emphasis on camaraderie and harmony, rather than competition. Being considerate of others and appreciating the natural beauty of the surroundings will ensure a positive experience and demonstrate respect for the local surfing culture.": "宫崎是一个著名的冲浪胜地，以其风景优美的海滩和完美的波浪而闻名。然而，在这里冲浪不仅仅是驾驭波浪——它关乎拥抱\"阿罗哈精神\"，即强调尊重、谦逊和社区。在访问像青岛海滩或串间这样的当地冲浪点时，遵守冲浪礼仪非常重要。这包括等待轮到自己、尊重当地冲浪者，以及避免在水中有攻击性行为。这里的氛围是悠闲的，强调友情与和谐，而非竞争。体谅他人并欣赏周围的自然美景，将确保一次积极的体验，并展示对当地冲浪文化的尊重。",

    "3. Respect the Nature and Spiritual Energy": "3. 尊重自然与精神能量",
    "Miyazaki is known not only for its stunning landscapes but also for its powerful spiritual energy, especially in places like Aoshima Island, Udo Shrine, and the surrounding coastlines. Locals believe these natural spots are filled with sacred power — known as power spots (パワースポット) — where people go to pray, heal, or feel connected to something greater. While the scenery may tempt visitors to explore freely or pose for dramatic photos, it's important to stay on marked paths, avoid climbing sacred rocks, and keep noise to a minimum. These areas are treated with quiet reverence, not just as tourist spots but as spiritual sanctuaries. Respecting the natural and mystical essence of these places helps preserve both the environment and the spiritual atmosphere that makes Miyazaki so unique.": "宫崎不仅以其壮丽的景观而闻名，还以其强大的精神能量而著称，尤其是在像青岛、鹈户神宫及周边海岸线这样的地方。当地人相信这些自然景点充满了神圣的力量——被称为\"能量点\"（power spots）——人们去那里祈祷、疗愈或感受与更大事物的联系。虽然风景可能会吸引游客自由探索或摆姿势拍照，但重要的是要走在标记的小径上，避免攀爬神圣的岩石，并尽量减少噪音。这些地区被以安静的崇敬对待，不仅仅是作为旅游景点，而是作为精神圣地。尊重这些地方的自然和神秘本质，有助于保护使宫崎如此独特的环境和精神氛围。"
