    "Introduction to the Tohoku Region": "东北地区介绍",
    "The Tohoku Region is located in the northern part of Japan's main island of Honshu, and is a region rich in nature and traditional culture. Consisting of six prefectures: Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Miyagi, Yamagata, and Fukushima, it features beautiful scenery with distinct four seasons, hospitable people, and unique culture and traditions. From snow-covered winters to lush summers, as well as delicious local cuisine, the Tohoku region is a must-visit destination for anyone wanting to experience the essence of Japan.": "东北地区位于日本本州北部，是一个拥有丰富自然和传统文化的地域。由青森、秋田、岩手、宫城、山形、福岛六个县组成，拥有四季分明的美丽风景、热情好客的人们以及独特的文化和传统。从白雪皑皑的冬季到绿意盎然的夏季，以及美味的乡土料理等，东北地区是想要体验日本精髓的游客必访之地。",

    "1. Akita": "1. 秋田",
    "1. Don’t talk back to obaachans (grandmas)": "1. 不要与老奶奶顶嘴",
    "In rural Akita, grandmas—known as obaachans—hold a special place in the community. They’re often strong-willed, outspoken, and deeply respected for their experience and wisdom. If an obaachan gives you advice, even if it sounds blunt or old-fashioned, it’s best not to argue or talk back. Just smile, nod, and say something polite like “thank you” or “I see.” Arguing, correcting them, or acting like you know better can come off as disrespectful, especially to older generations who value humility and harmony. In Akita, keeping the peace with elders isn’t just polite—it’s part of the social fabric.": "在秋田的农村地区，老奶奶（おばあちゃん）在社区中占有特殊地位。她们通常意志坚强、直言不讳，因其经验和智慧而深受尊敬。如果老奶奶给你建议，即使听起来直率或过时，最好不要争辩或顶嘴。只需微笑、点头，说些礼貌的话如\"谢谢\"或\"我明白了\"。争辩、纠正她们或表现得比她们更懂行，可能会显得不尊重，特别是对那些重视谦逊和和谐的老年一代。在秋田，与长辈保持和谐不仅是礼貌，更是社会结构的一部分。",
    
    "2. Always accept rice and pickles": "2. 一定要接受米饭和腌菜",
    "When visiting someone’s home in Akita, especially in rural areas, it’s common for hosts to offer simple homemade food—usually a bowl of rice and some pickles like tsukemono or the local specialty iburigakko (smoked daikon pickles). Even if you’re not hungry or don’t usually eat pickles, refusing them outright can be seen as rude or ungrateful.": "在秋田拜访别人家时，特别是在农村地区，主人通常会提供简单的家常菜——通常是一碗米饭和一些腌菜，如渍物或当地特产いぶりがっこ（烟熏萝卜腌菜）。即使你不饿或通常不吃腌菜，直接拒绝可能被视为粗鲁或不感恩。",
    "These small offerings aren’t just snacks—they’re a gesture of hospitality, tradition, and pride. Accepting them with a smile, or at least taking a small bite, shows respect for the local culture and the effort of the person offering them. In Akita, food is a way of connecting—and declining it too quickly might accidentally send the wrong message.": "这些小小的招待不仅仅是零食——它们是热情好客、传统和自豪的表现。带着微笑接受，或至少尝一小口，表明对当地文化和提供者努力的尊重。在秋田，食物是连接的方式——拒绝得太快可能会无意中传达错误的信息。",
    
    "3. Don’t stand in the middle of an onsen changing room": "3. 不要在温泉更衣室中间站立",
    "In Akita, where onsen culture is deeply rooted, there are unspoken rules that locals naturally follow—especially in the changing rooms. One important point is to avoid standing around in the middle of the dressing area, especially while undressed. Locals value modesty and efficiency in these shared spaces. It’s expected that you quietly and quickly change, keeping your personal space minimal and not blocking others.": "在温泉文化根深蒂固的秋田，当地人自然遵循一些不成文的规则——特别是在更衣室。重要的一点是避免在更衣区域的中间站立，特别是裸体时。当地人在这些共享空间中重视谦逊和效率。期望你安静快速地更衣，保持个人空间最小化，不阻挡他人。",
    "Lingering, stretching, or chatting loudly in the middle of the room can make people uncomfortable and disrupt the peaceful atmosphere. The same goes for the bath itself—quiet, respectful behavior is the norm. If you want to blend in like a local, keep it low-key, move with purpose, and always be mindful of others around you.": "在房间中间逗留、伸展或大声聊天会让人感到不适，破坏平静的氛围。泡澡本身也是如此——安静、尊重的行为是常态。如果你想像当地人一样融入，保持低调，有目的地行动，始终注意周围的人。",
    
    "4. Respect the festivals": "4. 尊重节日庆典",
    "The Festivals in Akita, such as the famous Kanto Matsuri and Kamakura Snow Festival, are much more than just celebrations—they are deeply rooted cultural and spiritual events that locals take great pride in. These festivals often involve intricate rituals, community cooperation, and a strong sense of tradition passed down through generations. When attending or even just observing, it’s important to show respect by following the rules, being polite, and not treating the events as mere entertainment.": "秋田的节日，如著名的竿灯祭和雪屋祭，不仅仅是庆祝活动——它们是深深植根的文化和精神活动，当地人为此感到非常自豪。这些节日通常涉及复杂的仪式、社区合作和代代相传的强烈传统意识。参加或仅仅观察时，重要的是通过遵守规则、保持礼貌和不将活动仅仅视为娱乐来表现尊重。",
    "Locals expect visitors to appreciate the significance behind the ceremonies and to participate in a way that honors their customs. Disrespectful behavior, loud disruptions, or mocking the traditions can offend people who view these festivals as sacred parts of their identity.": "当地人期望游客理解仪式背后的意义，并以尊重他们习俗的方式参与。不尊重的行为、大声喧哗或嘲笑传统可能会冒犯那些将这些节日视为身份神圣部分的人。",
    
    "5. Don’t make fun of Namahage": "5. 不要取笑生剥鬼",
    "Namahage is a unique and important folklore tradition in Akita, where demon-like figures visit homes during New Year’s to scare away laziness and bad luck. While the costumes and masks might look scary or even funny to outsiders, locals take Namahage very seriously as a symbol of cultural heritage and community values.": "生剥鬼是秋田独特而重要的民间传说传统，在新年期间，恶魔般的人物会拜访家庭以驱赶懒惰和厄运。虽然服装和面具对外人来说可能看起来很可怕甚至有趣，但当地人将生剥鬼视为文化遗产和社区价值观的象征而非常认真对待。",
    "Making fun of the Namahage, mocking their appearance, or treating the tradition lightly can be seen as disrespectful and offensive to those who have grown up with these stories and rituals.When encountering Namahage—whether at festivals or in stories—it’s important to show respect and understand the deeper meaning behind this powerful local custom.": "取笑生剥鬼、嘲笑他们的外表或轻率地对待传统，对那些与这些故事和仪式一起长大的人来说可能被视为不尊重和冒犯。遇到生剥鬼时——无论是在节日还是在故事中——重要的是要表现尊重并理解这种强大当地习俗背后的深层含义。",
    
    "6. Snow clearing is a community duty": "6. 除雪是社区责任",
    "In many parts of Akita, heavy snowfall is a normal part of winter, and dealing with it is considered a shared responsibility among community members. It’s not just about clearing the snow from your own driveway or walkway—locals often help shovel snow from public paths, neighbors’ entrances, and shared spaces to keep the whole neighborhood safe and accessible. Leaving large piles of snow blocking roads or sidewalks is frowned upon, as it inconveniences others and can cause accidents. This collective effort reflects the strong sense of cooperation and mutual support that is typical of life in Akita’s snowy regions, where everyone pitches in to make the winter easier for all.": "在秋田的许多地区，大量降雪是冬季的正常部分，处理降雪被认为是社区成员的共同责任。不仅仅是清理自己车道或人行道上的雪——当地人经常帮助铲除公共道路、邻居入口和共享空间的雪，以保持整个社区的安全和可访问性。留下大堆雪阻塞道路或人行道是不受欢迎的，因为它会给他人带来不便并可能导致事故。这种集体努力反映了秋田雪区生活中典型的强烈合作和相互支持意识，每个人都为让冬季对所有人来说更容易而贡献力量。",

    "2. Miyagi": "2. 宫城",
    "1.Respect the tradition of “Zunda” sweets": "1. 尊重\"毛豆\"甜点的传统",
    "In Miyagi, zunda, a sweet paste made from mashed edamame (young soybeans), is more than just a local snack—it’s a cherished symbol of the region’s culinary heritage. When offered zunda mochi or other zunda-based sweets, it’s important to accept them graciously and compliment the unique flavor.": "在宫城，毛豆（用捣碎的毛豆制成的甜糊）不仅仅是当地小吃——它是该地区烹饪遗产的珍贵象征。当提供毛豆麻糬或其他毛豆甜点时，重要的是要优雅地接受并赞美其独特风味。",
    "Locals take pride in this traditional treat, which has been enjoyed for generations, and showing appreciation for zunda is a way of respecting Miyagi’s culture and history. Dismissing it or refusing it outright might be seen as a lack of understanding or appreciation for one of Miyagi’s most famous delicacies.": "当地人为这种世代享用的传统美食感到自豪，对毛豆表示欣赏是尊重宫城文化和历史的方式。轻视或直接拒绝可能被视为对宫城最著名美食之一缺乏理解或欣赏。",
    
    "2. Celebrate cherry blossoms quietly in small groups": "2. 安静地在小群体中庆祝樱花",
    "In Miyagi, the tradition of enjoying cherry blossoms, especially in famous spots like Shiogama and Matsushima, is often done with a sense of calm and respect. Unlike the large, loud hanami parties you might see in bigger cities, locals prefer to celebrate the season quietly with close friends or family.": "在宫城，欣赏樱花的传统，特别是在盐釜和松岛等著名景点，通常以平静和尊重的感觉进行。与你在大城市可能看到的大型、喧闹的赏花派对不同，当地人更喜欢与亲密的朋友或家人安静地庆祝这个季节。",
    "The focus is on appreciating the beauty of the blossoms in a peaceful atmosphere rather than making a noisy event out of it. Additionally, cleaning up thoroughly after hanami is an important part of the tradition, reflecting the local value placed on keeping nature and public spaces clean for everyone to enjoy year after year.": "重点是在和平的氛围中欣赏花朵的美丽，而不是将其变成喧闹的活动。此外，赏花后彻底清理是传统的重要组成部分，反映了当地重视保持自然和公共空间清洁的价值，让每个人年复一年地享受。",
    
    "3. Don’t rush when visiting Matsushima": "3. 访问松岛时不要匆忙",
    "Matsushima Bay, known as one of Japan’s three most scenic spots, is treasured by locals for its serene beauty and peaceful atmosphere. When visiting Matsushima, Miyagi locals believe in taking time to slowly enjoy the view rather than rushing through the area. Moving quickly, speaking loudly, or acting in a hurried way is seen as disrespectful to the natural environment and the cultural significance of the place. Visitors are encouraged to appreciate the scenery mindfully, soaking in the calm and tranquility that makes Matsushima so special to the people of Miyagi.": "松岛湾作为日本三大景观之一而闻名，因其宁静的美景和平和的氛围而受到当地人的珍视。访问松岛时，宫城当地人相信要花时间慢慢欣赏景色，而不是匆忙穿过该地区。快速移动、大声说话或匆忙行事被视为对自然环境和文化意义的不尊重。鼓励游客用心欣赏风景，沉浸在使松岛对宫城人民如此特别的平静和宁静中。",
    
    "4.Be mindful of spring water etiquette": "4. 注意泉水礼仪",
    "In certain areas of Miyagi, such as Zao and Shiroishi, natural spring water is considered pure, sacred, and even life-giving. Locals treat these water sources with quiet respect, not just as places to fill bottles but as part of the natural and spiritual landscape. When using these springs, it’s important to avoid wasting water, splashing, or washing dirty items in the area.": "在宫城的某些地区，如藏王和白石，天然泉水被认为是纯净、神圣甚至赋予生命的。当地人带着安静的尊重对待这些水源，不仅仅是作为装满瓶子的地方，而是作为自然和精神景观的一部分。使用这些泉水时，重要的是避免浪费水、溅水或在区域清洗脏物品。",
    "People often wait patiently in line, take only what they need, and make sure to leave the place clean. Being careless or treating the spring like a casual tap is frowned upon—respecting the water means respecting the land and the community that protects it.": "人们经常耐心排队，只取所需，并确保保持地方清洁。粗心大意或像对待普通水龙头一样对待泉水是不受欢迎的——尊重水意味着尊重保护它的土地和社区。",
    
    "5.Visiting local shrines: remove hats and bow deeply": "5. 访问当地神社：脱帽并深深鞠躬",
    "When visiting local shrines in Miyagi, especially smaller or lesser-known ones in rural areas, showing proper respect is taken seriously. Locals often remove their hats before entering the shrine grounds as a sign of humility. It’s also common to bow deeply at the torii gate before entering and again when leaving. These gestures, though simple, carry deep cultural meaning and reflect a quiet reverence for the spiritual space. Acting casually, wearing hats, or skipping bows can come off as disrespectful, even if unintentionally. Following these small but important customs helps you connect with the local spirit of respect and tradition.": "访问宫城的当地神社时，特别是在农村地区较小或不太知名的神社，认真对待表现适当的尊重。当地人通常在进入神社场地前脱帽作为谦逊的标志。在进入鸟居门时深深鞠躬，离开时再次鞠躬也很常见。这些手势虽然简单，但承载着深厚的文化意义，反映了对精神空间的安静敬畏。随意行事、戴帽子或跳过鞠躬可能显得不尊重，即使是无意的。遵循这些小而重要的习俗有助于你与当地尊重和传统的精神联系。",

    "In Iwate, modesty isn’t just polite—it’s a way of life. Whether in the cities like Morioka or in rural farming towns, locals value humility and quiet strength.

Instead, people in Iwate tend to respect those who are soft-spoken, hardworking, and unassuming.": "在岩手，谦逊不仅仅是礼貌——它是一种生活方式。无论是在盛冈这样的城市还是在农村农业城镇，当地人都重视谦逊和安静的力量。过多谈论你的成就、财富或个人成功可能显得自夸，即使你不是那个意思。相反，岩手人倾向于尊重那些说话温和、勤奋工作、不张扬的人。",

    "Wanko Soba is one of Iwate’s most famous food traditions, especially in Morioka and Hanamaki, and it comes with its own set of unspoken rules. When you sit down for Wanko Soba, servers will keep refilling your bowl with small portions of soba noodles as soon as you finish one—often at lightning speed. The key rule is this: if you want to stop, you must cover your bowl with a lid or place your hand over it.": "碗子荞麦面是岩手最著名的饮食传统之一，特别是在盛冈和花卷，它有自己的不成文规则。当你坐下来吃碗子荞麦面时，服务员会在你吃完一碗后立即用小份荞麦面重新装满你的碗——通常以闪电般的速度。关键规则是：如果你想停止，必须用盖子盖住碗或把手放在上面。",

It’s meant to be a fun and lively experience, but knowing how to follow the custom shows respect for the tradition and the people keeping it alive.": "否则，他们会继续为你服务，没有信号就停止可能会让服务员困惑或打破流程。这应该是一个有趣和活跃的体验，但知道如何遵循习俗表明对传统和保持传统活力的人的尊重。",

Hayachine and the surrounding woods are often considered sacred, with many locals believing in the presence of mountain spirits or kami. Because of this, wandering off trails, shouting, or treating the forest like a place for casual play or selfies is seen as disrespectful.": "在岩手，森林和山脉不仅仅是美丽的自然空间——它们是具有深厚精神和文化意义的地方。早池峰山和周围森林等地区通常被认为是神圣的，许多当地人相信山灵或神的存在。因此，偏离小径、大喊大叫或将森林当作随意玩耍或自拍的地方被视为不尊重。",
