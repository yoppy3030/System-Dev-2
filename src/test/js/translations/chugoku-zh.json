    "Introduction to the ChugokuRegion": "中国地区介绍",
    "The Chugoku region, located in western Honshu, is a land of striking contrasts — from bustling port cities to tranquil mountain villages, and from ancient shrines to industrial hubs. Comprising five prefectures — Hiroshima, Okayama, Shimane, Tottori, and Yamaguchi — Chugoku offers a rich blend of history, nature, and regional identity. Hiroshima stands as a global symbol of peace and resilience, while places like Izumo in Shimane preserve deep spiritual traditions rooted in Japan's oldest myths. The region is also known for its scenic coastline, fresh seafood, traditional crafts, and unique dialects. Whether exploring the peaceful sand dunes of Tottori or walking across the legendary Kintai Bridge in Yamaguchi, visitors to Chugoku can experience a quieter, more reflective side of Japan, steeped in both historical gravity and local pride.": "中国地区位于本州西部，是一个具有鲜明对比的土地——从繁华的港口城市到宁静的山村，从古代神社到工业中心。由广岛、冈山、岛根、鸟取和山口五个县组成，中国地区提供了历史、自然和地区身份的丰富融合。广岛作为和平与韧性的全球象征而屹立，而岛根的出云等地则保存着根植于日本最古老神话的深厚精神传统。该地区还以其风景如画的海岸线、新鲜的海鲜、传统手工艺和独特的方言而闻名。无论是探索鸟取宁静的沙丘，还是漫步山口传奇的锦带桥，中国地区的游客都能体验到日本更安静、更具反思性的一面，沉浸在历史厚重感和当地自豪感中。",

    "Chugoku region": "中国地区",

    "1. Hiroshima": "1. 广岛",
    "1. Avoid Political Jokes About the Atomic Bomb": "1. 避免关于原子弹的政治笑话",
    "In Hiroshima, the memory of the atomic bombing is not just a part of history — it's a living, deeply emotional reality for many residents. As such, even casual jokes, political comments, or lighthearted references to nuclear weapons or war can be seen as deeply insensitive. Locals expect visitors to approach the subject with empathy and seriousness. Making remarks, no matter how harmless they may seem elsewhere, can cause discomfort or offense. When visiting memorials or speaking with locals, it's important to show respect for the city's tragic past and its ongoing message of peace.": "在广岛，原子弹爆炸的记忆不仅仅是历史的一部分——对许多居民来说，这是一个活生生的、深深情感化的现实。因此，即使是随意的笑话、政治评论或对核武器或战争的轻松提及都可能被视为极其不敏感。当地人期望游客以同理心和严肃性来对待这个话题。发表评论，无论在其他地方看起来多么无害，都可能引起不适或冒犯。在参观纪念馆或与当地人交谈时，重要的是要表现出对这座城市悲惨过去和持续和平信息的尊重。",

    "2. Listen Closely to Dialect: Hiroshima-ben": "2. 仔细聆听方言：广岛弁",
    "The local dialect spoken in Hiroshima, known as Hiroshima-ben, is rich, expressive, and distinctly different from standard Japanese. It often sounds strong or even aggressive to outsiders, but it reflects the warmth and honesty of the people. Phrases like \"じゃけえ\" (meaning \"so\" or \"because\"), \"ぶち\" (meaning \"very\"), or \"いけん\" (meaning \"not good\" or \"don't do that\") are commonly used in everyday speech. While it might sound intense, locals don't mean to be rude — it's simply their way of speaking. Visitors are encouraged to listen and appreciate the uniqueness of this dialect, and even trying out a few Hiroshima-ben phrases can help connect more deeply with the community.": "在广岛使用的当地方言，被称为广岛弁，丰富、富有表现力，与标准日语明显不同。对外人来说，它听起来往往很强硬甚至具有攻击性，但它反映了人们的温暖和诚实。像\"じゃけえ\"（意思是\"所以\"或\"因为\"）、\"ぶち\"（意思是\"非常\"）或\"いけん\"（意思是\"不好\"或\"不要那样做\"）这样的短语在日常对话中经常使用。虽然听起来可能很强烈，但当地人并不是要粗鲁——这只是他们的说话方式。鼓励游客倾听并欣赏这种方言的独特性，甚至尝试几个广岛弁短语可以帮助与社区建立更深的联系。",

    "3. Folded Paper Cranes Are Sacred": "3. 折纸鹤是神圣的",
    "In Hiroshima, folded paper cranes — known as orizuru — are powerful symbols of peace, hope, and remembrance, especially connected to the story of Sadako Sasaki, a young girl who died from radiation after the atomic bombing. Visitors often bring thousands of these colorful cranes to the Peace Memorial Park as heartfelt offerings. While they may look like decorations, these cranes carry deep emotional weight and personal prayers. Touching, rearranging, or taking them is considered highly disrespectful. Tourists are expected to observe them quietly and understand their meaning — each crane represents a wish for a world without war.": "在广岛，折纸鹤——被称为折鹤——是和平、希望和纪念的有力象征，特别是与原子弹爆炸后因辐射而死亡的年轻女孩佐佐木祯子的故事相连。游客经常将数千只这些彩色鹤带到和平纪念公园作为衷心的祭品。虽然它们可能看起来像装饰品，但这些鹤承载着深厚的情感重量和个人祈祷。触摸、重新排列或拿走它们被认为是非常不尊重的。游客应该安静地观察它们并理解它们的含义——每只鹤都代表着一个没有战争的世界的愿望。",

    "4. Quiet Respect at Peace Memorial Sites": "4. 在和平纪念场所保持安静尊重",
    "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is not just a tourist attraction — it is a solemn space dedicated to the memory of the victims of the atomic bombing and a symbol of Hiroshima's call for global peace. Locals and survivors visit the park to mourn, reflect, and pray. As such, visitors are expected to behave with deep respect. Talking loudly, laughing, running around, or taking cheerful selfies in front of memorials like the Atomic Bomb Dome or the Children's Peace Monument can be seen as deeply inappropriate. Maintaining a quiet, respectful presence honors both the history and the ongoing message of peace that Hiroshima continues to share with the world.": "广岛和平纪念公园不仅仅是一个旅游景点——它是一个庄严的空间，致力于纪念原子弹爆炸的受害者，也是广岛呼吁世界和平的象征。当地人和幸存者到公园哀悼、反思和祈祷。因此，游客应该以深深的尊重行事。在原子弹圆顶或儿童和平纪念碑等纪念物前大声说话、大笑、跑来跑去或拍摄欢快的自拍照可能被视为极其不恰当。保持安静、尊重的存在既是对历史的尊重，也是对广岛继续与世界分享的持续和平信息的尊重。",

    "2. Okayama": "2. 冈山",
    "1. Respect for the Legend of Momotaro": "1. 尊重桃太郎传说",
    "Okayama is widely known as the birthplace of Momotaro, the legendary Peach Boy hero from Japanese folklore. For locals, Momotaro is more than just a children's story — he's a cultural symbol of bravery, kindness, and local pride. His image appears on everything from souvenirs and trains to statues and sweets like kibidango. While visitors are welcome to enjoy and engage with the story, mocking the tale, making inappropriate jokes, or treating it as merely a funny cartoon can come across as disrespectful. Showing appreciation for the legend and its significance helps visitors connect more deeply with the spirit of Okayama.": "冈山以日本民间传说中的传奇英雄桃太郎的诞生地而闻名。对当地人来说，桃太郎不仅仅是一个儿童故事——他是勇气、善良和当地自豪感的文化象征。他的形象出现在从纪念品和火车到雕像和像吉备团子这样的糖果等各种物品上。虽然欢迎游客享受和参与这个故事，但嘲笑故事、开不恰当的玩笑或仅仅将其视为有趣的卡通可能显得不尊重。表现出对传说及其重要性的欣赏有助于游客与冈山精神建立更深的联系。",

    "2. Okayama Castle Etiquette": "2. 冈山城礼仪",
    "Okayama Castle, often called the \"Crow Castle\" for its striking black exterior, is a proud symbol of the city's history and culture. While it has been reconstructed, it remains a place of quiet appreciation and learning. Visitors are expected to behave respectfully inside the castle grounds — this means speaking softly, not touching exhibits, and avoiding casual or loud selfies in sacred or historical areas. It's also considered poor manners to run or act playfully inside the castle, especially around traditional displays and cultural artifacts. Treating the space like a living museum, with curiosity and respect, honors the legacy the castle represents.": "冈山城因其醒目的黑色外观而常被称为\"乌城\"，是城市历史和文化的骄傲象征。虽然它已被重建，但它仍然是一个安静欣赏和学习的地方。游客应该在城堡场地内恭敬地行事——这意味着轻声说话、不触摸展品、避免在神圣或历史区域进行随意或大声的自拍。在城堡内奔跑或嬉戏也被认为是不礼貌的，特别是在传统展示和文化文物周围。以好奇心和尊重将空间当作活博物馆来对待，是对城堡所代表的遗产的尊重。",

    "3. Manners on the Kibi Plain Cycling Route": "3. 吉备平原自行车道的礼仪",
    "The Kibi Plain Cycling Route is one of Okayama's most scenic and culturally rich paths, stretching through tranquil rice fields, ancient shrines, and historic burial mounds. While it's a popular destination for cyclists, it's not a race track or entertainment zone. Locals expect visitors to ride at a calm pace, avoid blasting music, and show respect to the rural surroundings. Greeting farmers with a nod, slowing down near shrines, and refraining from loud conversations helps preserve the peaceful atmosphere. Treating the route as a shared cultural space — not just a tourist activity — shows mindfulness and earns quiet appreciation from the community.": "吉备平原自行车道是冈山最风景如画和文化丰富的路径之一，穿过宁静的稻田、古代神社和历史墓葬。虽然它是骑自行车者的热门目的地，但它不是赛道或娱乐区。当地人期望游客以平静的速度骑行，避免播放音乐，并对农村环境表示尊重。向农民点头致意、在神社附近减速、避免大声交谈有助于保持和平的氛围。将路线视为共享的文化空间——而不仅仅是旅游活动——表现出正念并获得社区的安静欣赏。",

    "4. Reverence for Kibidango (きびだんご)": "4. 对吉备团子的敬意",
    "Kibidango, a soft and slightly sweet dumpling made from millet flour, is one of Okayama's most iconic local treats — famously associated with the folk hero Momotaro. While it may look like a simple snack to visitors, kibidango carries cultural significance for the people of Okayama. It represents hospitality, tradition, and the enduring spirit of the Momotaro legend. Tossing it, making jokes about its texture, or treating it like cheap candy can be seen as disrespectful. Locals appreciate when tourists enjoy kibidango with sincerity, perhaps even learning its connection to the folklore. Eating it with gratitude is more than good manners — it's a quiet way to honor local pride.": "吉备团子是由小米粉制成的柔软微甜的团子，是冈山最具标志性的当地美食之一——与民间英雄桃太郎密切相关。虽然对游客来说可能看起来像简单的小吃，但吉备团子对冈山人民具有文化意义。它代表好客、传统和桃太郎传说的持久精神。扔掉它、对其质地开玩笑或将其当作廉价糖果可能被视为不尊重。当地人感谢游客真诚地享受吉备团子，甚至可能了解其与民间传说的联系。怀着感激之情食用它不仅仅是良好的礼仪——这是尊重当地自豪感的安静方式。",

    "3. Tottori": "3. 鸟取",
    "1.Don't Treat the Tottori Sand Dunes Like a Beach": "1. 不要将鸟取沙丘当作海滩",
    "The Tottori Sand Dunes are one of Japan's most unique natural landmarks, stretching along the Sea of Japan with stunning desert-like landscapes. While they may resemble a beach or desert playground, locals view the dunes as a precious and fragile environment. Activities like shouting, playing sports, digging, or leaving trash are considered highly disrespectful. The dunes are home to delicate ecosystems and are constantly shaped by wind and weather. Visitors are expected to walk carefully, stay on designated paths, and treat the area with quiet appreciation. Preserving the natural beauty of the dunes isn't just about following rules — it's about respecting a symbol of Tottori's identity.": "鸟取沙丘是日本最独特的自然地标之一，沿着日本海延伸，具有令人惊叹的沙漠般景观。虽然它们可能类似于海滩或沙漠游乐场，但当地人将沙丘视为珍贵而脆弱的环境。像喊叫、运动、挖掘或留下垃圾等活动被认为是非常不尊重的。沙丘是脆弱生态系统的家园，不断被风和天气塑造。游客应该小心行走，留在指定的小径上，并以安静的欣赏对待该地区。保护沙丘的自然美不仅仅是遵循规则——这是尊重鸟取身份象征的问题。",

    "2. Manga Manners in Mizuki Shigeru Road": "2. 水木茂路的漫画礼仪",
    "Mizuki Shigeru Road in Sakaiminato is a lively street dedicated to the beloved manga artist Mizuki Shigeru, creator of GeGeGe no Kitaro. The area is filled with bronze statues of yokai (Japanese spirits), manga art, and themed shops — attracting fans from all over the world. While it's a fun and interactive space, it's important to remember that this street is also a place of cultural pride and local daily life. Climbing on statues, blocking pathways for selfies, or behaving loudly in costume can disturb the respectful atmosphere. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy the area with care, ask for permission when photographing others (especially cosplayers), and treat the works of Mizuki Shigeru with the reverence they deserve.": "境港的水木茂路是一条热闹的街道，专门献给受人喜爱的漫画家水木茂，他是《鬼太郎》的创作者。该地区充满了妖怪（日本精灵）的青铜雕像、漫画艺术和主题商店——吸引着来自世界各地的粉丝。虽然这是一个有趣和互动的空间，但重要的是要记住这条街也是文化自豪感和当地日常生活的地方。爬雕像、为自拍阻挡通道或穿着戏服大声行为可能会扰乱尊重的氛围。鼓励游客小心地享受该地区，在拍摄他人（特别是角色扮演者）时请求许可，并以应有的敬意对待水木茂的作品。",

    "3. Don't Waste Your Butadon": "3. 不要浪费你的猪肉盖饭",
    "Obihiro is the proud birthplace of Butadon — a delicious rice bowl topped with grilled pork and sweet-savory sauce. This dish isn't just a local specialty; it represents the region's rich agricultural culture and high-quality pork production. For locals, Butadon is comfort food with deep meaning, often linked to family meals and regional pride. When tourists order Butadon and leave most of it uneaten, it can feel disrespectful — especially in a place where people value food deeply and understand the effort behind every ingredient. To show appreciation, visitors should only order what they can finish and take time to enjoy the flavor and care that goes into every bowl.": "带广是猪肉盖饭的骄傲发源地——一种美味的盖饭，上面铺着烤猪肉和甜咸酱汁。这道菜不仅仅是当地特产；它代表了该地区丰富的农业文化和高品质的猪肉生产。对当地人来说，猪肉盖饭是具有深刻意义的舒适食品，经常与家庭餐和地区自豪感联系在一起。当游客点猪肉盖饭却留下大部分不吃时，这可能显得不尊重——特别是在人们深深珍惜食物并理解每种食材背后努力的地方。为了表示欣赏，游客应该只点他们能吃完的量，并花时间享受每碗饭中的味道和用心。",

    "4. Respect the \"Wagyu Capital\"": "4. 尊重\"和牛之都\"",
    "Tottori takes great pride in its wagyu heritage, often overlooked but deeply respected among beef connoisseurs. Known as the birthplace of some of Japan's finest black cattle, Tottori produces premium-quality wagyu like Tottori Kuroushi and Olein 55, known for its exceptional marbling and buttery texture. For locals, this isn't just food — it's the result of generations of careful breeding and craftsmanship. When enjoying wagyu in Tottori, it's best to avoid comparing it to more famous varieties like Kobe or Matsusaka beef. Even light comments suggesting one is better than the other may come off as dismissive. Instead, expressing genuine appreciation for the unique flavor and local pride behind Tottori wagyu shows cultural sensitivity and respect for what the region has perfected.": "鸟取以其和牛传统而深感自豪，虽然经常被忽视，但在牛肉鉴赏家中深受尊敬。作为日本最优质黑毛和牛的发源地而闻名，鸟取生产像鸟取黑牛和Olein 55这样的优质和牛，以其卓越的大理石花纹和黄油般的质地而闻名。对当地人来说，这不仅仅是食物——这是几代人精心育种和工艺的结果。在鸟取享用和牛时，最好避免将其与神户牛或松阪牛等更著名的品种进行比较。即使是暗示一个比另一个更好的轻描淡写的评论也可能显得轻蔑。相反，对鸟取和牛背后独特风味和当地自豪感的真诚欣赏表现出文化敏感性和对该地区所完善事物的尊重。",

    "4. Yamaguchi": "4. 山口",
    "1. Don't Run or Climb on the Kintai Bridge": "1. 不要在锦带桥上奔跑或攀爬",
    "The Kintai Bridge in Iwakuni is one of Japan's most iconic wooden bridges, famous for its elegant five-arch design and centuries-old craftsmanship. While it may seem like a fun structure to explore, locals take its preservation very seriously. Running, jumping, or climbing on the arches is not only dangerous but also deeply disrespectful to a structure that symbolizes local pride and history. The bridge has been rebuilt and maintained with traditional techniques, making it more than just a sightseeing spot — it's a living piece of heritage. Visitors are expected to cross it slowly, take in the view with care, and treat it with the same respect as a historic monument.": "岩国的锦带桥是日本最具标志性的木桥之一，以其优雅的五拱设计和数百年历史的工艺而闻名。虽然它可能看起来像探索的有趣结构，但当地人非常认真地对待其保护。在拱门上奔跑、跳跃或攀爬不仅危险，而且对象征当地自豪感和历史的建筑非常不尊重。这座桥用传统技术重建和维护，使其不仅仅是观光景点——它是活生生的遗产。游客应该慢慢穿过它，小心地欣赏景色，并以对待历史纪念碑同样的尊重来对待它。",

    "2. Fugu Etiquette in Shimonoseki": "2. 下关的河豚礼仪",
    "Shimonoseki is Japan's top producer and culinary capital of fugu — the famously delicate and potentially poisonous blowfish. In this city, fugu isn't just exotic food; it's a symbol of refined skill and deep culinary tradition. Only licensed chefs are allowed to prepare it, often after years of training. Because of its dangerous reputation, some tourists are tempted to make jokes or light-hearted remarks about dying or taking risks while eating it. However, in Shimonoseki, such comments are seen as disrespectful to the chefs and the culture surrounding fugu. Locals expect diners to approach the experience with appreciation and quiet confidence, recognizing the care and technique behind every slice.": "下关是日本最大的河豚生产地和烹饪之都——著名的精致且潜在有毒的河豚。在这个城市，河豚不仅仅是异国美食；它是精湛技艺和深厚烹饪传统的象征。只有经过多年培训的持证厨师才被允许准备它。由于其危险的名声，一些游客在食用时会忍不住开关于死亡或冒险的玩笑或轻松评论。然而，在下关，这样的评论被视为对厨师和河豚文化的不尊重。当地人期望食客以欣赏和安静自信的态度对待这种体验，认识到每片河豚背后的用心和技艺。",

    "3.Quiet Participation in the Lantern Festivals": "3. 在灯笼节中安静参与",
    "Yamaguchi's lantern festivals, especially the Tanabata Lantern Festival, are serene and spiritual events that light up the streets with soft, glowing beauty. During these festivals, thousands of handmade lanterns line roads and temple grounds, creating a peaceful and almost sacred atmosphere. While it's natural to want to take photos, pushing through crowds, using flash, or loudly chatting with friends can disrupt the mood that locals work hard to preserve. These festivals are not loud celebrations — they are moments of reflection, tradition, and quiet beauty. Visitors are encouraged to walk slowly, observe silently, and fully absorb the gentle magic of the lantern-lit night.": "山口的灯笼节，特别是七夕灯笼节，是宁静而精神性的活动，用柔和、发光的美点亮街道。在这些节日期间，数千只手制灯笼排列在道路和寺庙场地上，营造出和平而几乎神圣的氛围。虽然想要拍照是很自然的，但推挤人群、使用闪光灯或与朋友大声聊天可能会破坏当地人努力维护的氛围。这些节日不是喧闹的庆祝活动——它们是反思、传统和安静美丽的时刻。鼓励游客慢慢行走，安静观察，充分吸收灯笼照亮的夜晚的温柔魔力。",

    "4.Show Respect at Ruriko-ji Temple and Mori Clan Sites": "4. 在琉璃光寺和毛利氏族遗址表示尊重",
    "Ruriko-ji Temple in Yamaguchi is home to one of Japan's most beautiful five-story pagodas and is closely tied to the legacy of the Mori Clan, a powerful family that once ruled much of western Japan. These sacred sites are not just tourist attractions — they are places of deep historical and spiritual importance. Visitors should avoid loud conversations, casual selfies, or playful behavior within temple grounds and especially near the Mori family graves and memorials. Instead, a quiet, respectful presence is appreciated, whether you're walking through the mossy paths, viewing the pagoda, or offering a silent prayer. Showing reverence in these spaces honors both local culture and centuries of heritage.": "山口的琉璃光寺拥有日本最美丽的五层宝塔之一，与曾经统治西日本大部分地区的强大家族毛利氏族的遗产密切相关。这些神圣场所不仅仅是旅游景点——它们是具有深厚历史和精神重要性的地方。游客应该避免在寺庙场地内，特别是毛利家族坟墓和纪念碑附近大声交谈、随意自拍或嬉戏行为。相反，无论您是走过苔藓覆盖的小径、观看宝塔还是默默祈祷，安静、尊重的存在都会受到赞赏。在这些空间中表示敬意既是对当地文化的尊重，也是对数百年遗产的尊重。",
