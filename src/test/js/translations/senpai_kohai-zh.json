    "The traditional hierarchy that shapes professional behavior in Japan.": "塑造日本职场行为的传统等级制度。",
    "What is the Senpai-Kohai Relationship?": "什么是前辈-后辈关系？",
    "The Senpai-Kohai (先輩・後輩) system is deeply rooted in Japanese culture, extending far beyond schools and into workplaces. A senpai is someone with more experience—typically older or with longer tenure—while a kohai is a junior member. This relationship promotes mutual respect, loyalty, and learning.": "前辈-后辈（先輩・後輩）制度深植于日本文化，不仅存在于学校，也延伸到职场。前辈通常是更有经验、年长或资历更深的人，后辈则是较年轻或新加入的成员。这种关系强调相互尊重、忠诚和学习。",
    "Respect and Communication": "尊重与沟通",
    "In Japanese companies, kohai are expected to show deference through language (using polite forms), behavior (bowing, offering seats), and decision-making. Kohai often seek permission or advice from their senpai before acting. In return, senpai take responsibility for guiding and mentoring their juniors.": "在日本企业中，后辈需要通过敬语、鞠躬、让座等方式，以及在决策时，向前辈表达尊重。后辈在行动前通常会征求前辈的意见或许可。作为回报，前辈有责任指导和培养后辈，帮助他们成长。",
    "Hierarchy and Harmony": "等级与和谐",
    "The senpai-kohai dynamic reinforces the broader emphasis on group harmony (和 – wa). By understanding one's position and acting accordingly, disruptions are minimized. Promotions and trust are often built through loyalty and respect, not just performance.": "前辈-后辈关系强化了日本社会对集体和谐（和）的重视。每个人明确自己的角色并据此行事，有助于减少冲突。晋升和信任往往建立在忠诚与尊重之上，而不仅仅是业绩。",
    "Modern Challenges": "现代挑战",
    "While the system has benefits, it can also create pressure. Younger workers may feel reluctant to question older colleagues, even when innovation is needed. Some modern workplaces are adapting, encouraging more balanced communication while still honoring tradition.": "这种制度有其优势，但也可能带来压力。年轻员工即使有创新想法，也可能不愿直接质疑年长同事。如今，一些现代企业正在做出调整，在尊重传统的同时，鼓励更平等和开放的沟通。",
