    "Introduction to the Shikoku Region": "四国地区简介",
    "Shikoku, the smallest of Japan's four main islands, is a region rich in spiritual heritage, natural beauty, and traditional charm. Comprising four prefectures — Tokushima, Kagawa, Ehime, and Kochi — Shikoku is best known for the Shikoku Henro, a sacred 88-temple pilgrimage route that draws both devout followers and curious travelers from across the world. Beyond its spiritual appeal, Shikoku offers stunning coastlines, lush mountains, and vibrant local cultures. Kagawa is famed for its udon noodles, Tokushima for its Awa Odori dance festival, Ehime for its historic Dogo Onsen, and Kochi for its rivers and samurai history. Far less crowded than Japan's major cities, Shikoku welcomes visitors with warm hospitality and a pace of life that invites reflection and connection with both people and place.": "四国是日本四大主岛中最小的一个，拥有丰富的精神遗产、自然美景和传统魅力。由德岛、香川、爱媛和高知四个县组成，以著名的四国遍路（88座寺庙朝圣之路）闻名于世，吸引着世界各地的信徒和旅行者。除了宗教氛围外，四国还有壮丽的海岸线、郁郁葱葱的山脉和充满活力的地方文化。香川以乌冬面著称，德岛以阿波舞闻名，爱媛有历史悠久的道后温泉，高知则以清流和武士历史著称。与日本大城市相比，四国人少而温馨，热情好客，生活节奏悠闲，让人能够静心感受人与土地的联系。",

    "Shikoku region": "四国地区",

    "1. Tokushima": "1. 德岛",
    "1. Awa Odori Dance Etiquette": "1. 阿波舞礼仪",
    "Awa Odori, held every August in Tokushima City, is one of Japan's most iconic and energetic dance festivals, attracting thousands of performers and spectators. While the festival is filled with joyful music, lively chants, and vibrant movement, it's also a deeply rooted cultural tradition with over 400 years of history. For locals, Awa Odori is not just entertainment — it's a symbol of identity and community spirit. Visitors are welcome to enjoy the atmosphere and may even be invited to join in designated \"niwaka-ren\" (casual dance groups). However, mocking the dance, interrupting performers, or stepping into processions for selfies is considered very disrespectful. Proper etiquette means watching with appreciation, following staff directions, and joining respectfully if invited. Treating the event with the same spirit of joy and reverence as the locals helps preserve its proud legacy.": "每年8月在德岛市举行的阿波舞，是日本最具代表性的热情舞蹈节之一，吸引了成千上万的表演者和观众。这个节日不仅充满欢快的音乐和舞蹈，更有400多年的深厚文化传统。对当地人来说，阿波舞不仅是娱乐，更是身份和社区精神的象征。游客可以欣赏氛围，甚至有机会加入\"临时连\"体验，但切勿嘲笑舞蹈、打断表演或为自拍闯入队伍。应遵守礼仪，听从工作人员指示，被邀请时要有礼貌地参与。以尊重和喜悦的心态对待活动，才能传承其宝贵的传统。",

    "2. Respect for Henro Pilgrims": "2. 尊重遍路朝圣者",
    "Tokushima is the starting point of the Shikoku Henro, a sacred 88-temple pilgrimage route that spans over 1,200 kilometers across the island. Many pilgrims (called ohenro-san) walk for weeks or even months, dressed in white robes and straw hats, seeking spiritual growth, healing, or personal reflection. In Tokushima, it's common to see these pilgrims quietly making their way through towns, mountains, and temple grounds. Locals often offer small gifts or words of encouragement, and visitors are encouraged to show the same respect. It's important not to interrupt their rituals, take photos without permission, or make light of their journey. Offering a quiet nod or a simple \"ganbatte kudasai\" (do your best) is a thoughtful way to acknowledge their commitment. The Henro path is not a tourist attraction — it's a living spiritual tradition that deserves reverence.": "德岛是四国遍路（88寺庙朝圣之路）的起点。许多朝圣者（称为\"遍路\"）身穿白衣、戴斗笠，步行数周甚至数月，追求精神成长和自我反思。在德岛，常能看到他们安静地穿行于城镇、山间和寺庙。当地人常会送上小礼物或鼓励的话语，游客也应给予同样的尊重。不要打扰他们的仪式、未经允许拍照或轻视他们的旅程。可以安静地点头或说一句\"加油\"来表达敬意。遍路之路不是旅游景点，而是活生生的精神传统，值得尊重。",

    "3. Respect at Naruto Whirlpools": "3. 鸣门漩涡的参观礼仪",
    "The Naruto Whirlpools, located between Tokushima and Awaji Island, are one of Japan's most dramatic natural wonders, caused by powerful tidal currents swirling through the Naruto Strait. While the sight is thrilling and draws many tourists, it also holds cultural and environmental significance for locals. When visiting by sightseeing boat or from viewing platforms like the Ōnaruto Bridge Walk, visitors are expected to behave respectfully. Shouting, throwing objects into the water, or treating the area like an amusement spot is frowned upon. The whirlpools are part of Tokushima's pride, and locals take their preservation seriously. Observing in quiet awe, taking care not to disturb the environment, and following tour staff instructions helps maintain the dignity of this natural phenomenon.": "鸣门漩涡位于德岛与淡路岛之间，是日本著名的自然奇观。虽然吸引了众多游客，但对当地人来说，这里具有重要的文化和环境意义。乘观光船或在大桥步道观赏时，请保持安静，不要大声喧哗、向水中投掷物品或将其当作游乐场。漩涡是德岛的骄傲，当地人非常重视保护。请安静观赏，遵守工作人员指示，尊重自然环境。",

    "2. Kochi": "2. 高知",
    "1. Izakaya Manners: The \"Otōshi\" and First Pour": "1. 居酒屋礼仪：小菜与互相倒酒",
    "In Kochi, dining and drinking are not just about food — they're about connection and ritual. When visiting an izakaya (Japanese pub), you'll typically be served a small appetizer called \"otōshi\" as soon as you sit down. Even if you didn't order it, it's a standard part of the dining experience and a sign of hospitality — not something to refuse or leave untouched. More importantly, Kochi's people are known for their warm and lively drinking culture, where pouring drinks for others is a key sign of respect. It's considered poor manners to pour your own drink; instead, you should pour for your companions and let them return the gesture. This simple act reflects the strong sense of social bonding and mutual care that defines Kochi's cheerful, community-oriented spirit.": "在高知的居酒屋，入座后会自动送上一道叫\"お通し\"的小菜，这是待客之道，不要拒绝或不吃。此外，高知人以热情的饮酒文化著称，互相倒酒是尊重的表现，自己给自己倒酒被视为不礼貌。请为同伴倒酒，并接受对方的回敬，这体现了高知人重视人际关系和互相关心的精神。",

    "2. Be Gentle Around the Shimanto River": "2. 爱护四万十川",
    "The Shimanto River, often called \"Japan's last clear stream,\" is one of Kochi's most treasured natural landmarks. Flowing through unspoiled countryside, it represents the region's deep connection to clean water, sustainable living, and traditional fishing. Visitors often come to enjoy canoeing, cycling, and scenic walks along its banks — but this beauty comes with responsibility. Locals take great care to preserve the river's purity, so littering, disturbing wildlife, or swimming recklessly is strongly discouraged. Traditional fishing methods, such as ukai (cormorant fishing) or yubiki (hand fishing), are still practiced here and should be observed with quiet respect. Whether you're relaxing on the riverbanks or crossing one of the famous chinkabashi (submersible bridges), treating the Shimanto River gently ensures that this rare natural treasure remains pristine for generations to come.": "四万十川被称为\"日本最后的清流\"，是高知最珍贵的自然景观。游客常来此划独木舟、骑行或散步，但请勿乱扔垃圾、惊扰动植物或危险游泳。这里仍保留着鸬鹚捕鱼、徒手捕鱼等传统渔法，参观时请安静观赏。无论是在河边休息还是走在沉下桥上，都要爱护这片自然，让美景世代相传。",

    "3. Honor the Samurai Legacy of Sakamoto Ryoma": "3. 尊重坂本龙马的历史",
    "In Kochi, few historical figures are held in higher esteem than Sakamoto Ryoma, a visionary samurai who played a pivotal role in modernizing Japan during the final years of the Edo period. Born in Kochi, Ryoma is celebrated for his progressive ideals, efforts to unify rival domains, and push for peaceful political reform. Statues, museums, and even airports in Kochi proudly bear his name, reflecting the deep respect locals have for his legacy. When visiting sites associated with Ryoma — such as Katsurahama Beach, Sakamoto Ryoma Memorial Museum, or his childhood home — it's important to treat them with the same reverence that residents do. Making light of his story or treating historical locations as casual photo spots can come off as insensitive. By learning about his life and showing respect, visitors can better appreciate the pride and identity that Ryoma continues to inspire in Kochi today.": "在高知，坂本龙马是最受尊敬的历史人物之一。他推动了日本近代化，至今在高知有雕像、纪念馆和以他命名的机场。参观桂滨、纪念馆等相关场所时，请像当地人一样怀着敬意，不要轻视其历史或随意拍照。了解他的生平并表达尊重，能更好地体会高知人的自豪与认同。",

    "3. Ehime": "3. 爱媛",
    "1. Be Courteous on the Shimanami Kaidō": "1. 骑行岛波海道的礼仪",
    "The Shimanami Kaidō is one of Japan's most scenic cycling routes, stretching about 70 kilometers and connecting Ehime Prefecture to Hiroshima across a chain of islands via impressive bridges. While it's popular with cyclists from around the world, it's also used daily by local residents, families, and even schoolchildren. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy the breathtaking views at a relaxed pace, but also to ride responsibly and courteously. That means keeping to the left, yielding to slower riders, avoiding loud music, and not treating the route like a racetrack. This shared path blends tourism and everyday life, so respecting the flow and presence of others ensures a safe and pleasant experience for everyone. Riding with mindfulness allows you to connect not just with the landscape — but with the rhythm of island life itself.": "岛波海道是连接爱媛和广岛、全长约70公里的绝美骑行路线。这里不仅有游客，还有许多本地居民、家庭和学生。请保持左侧通行，礼让慢行者，避免大声播放音乐，不要把路线当作赛道。旅游与生活共存，尊重他人才能让每个人都安全愉快地享受骑行。用心体验，不仅能感受风景，还能融入岛屿的生活节奏。",

    "2. Understand the Literary Legacy of Natsume Sōseki": "2. 了解夏目漱石与《少爷》",
    "Ehime holds a special place in Japanese literary history thanks to Natsume Sōseki, one of Japan's most celebrated authors. His novel \"Botchan\", written in 1906, is set in Matsuyama and remains a beloved story across Japan. The tale follows a young Tokyo teacher adjusting to rural life, capturing both humor and the cultural contrasts of the time. Today, landmarks like the Botchan Train, Dōgo Onsen, and various statues and museums in Matsuyama proudly honor the story. For locals, \"Botchan\" is more than just a book — it's a part of their cultural identity. While visitors are welcome to explore and even enjoy the playful elements tied to the novel, treating it lightly or mocking the characters can feel disrespectful. Showing genuine interest in Sōseki's work and its connection to Ehime adds a thoughtful layer to your visit and demonstrates appreciation for the region's literary pride.": "爱媛因夏目漱石的小说《少爷》而闻名。松山有少爷列车、道后温泉等与小说相关的景点。对当地人来说，《少爷》不仅是文学作品，更是文化认同的一部分。游客可以体验相关景点，但请不要轻视或嘲笑作品和人物。用心了解漱石及其与爱媛的联系，会让您的旅行更有意义。",

    "3. Appreciate Mikan Culture": "3. 欣赏蜜柑文化",
    "Ehime Prefecture is often called the \"Kingdom of Mikan,\" thanks to its ideal climate and long history of producing some of Japan's sweetest and juiciest mandarin oranges. For locals, mikan are more than just a fruit — they're a symbol of warmth, hospitality, and regional pride. You'll find mikan used in everything from juice and jam to desserts and bath products. Many families even grow their own. When visiting Ehime, it's important to treat mikan with respect: don't waste them, don't scoff at their simplicity, and don't compare them negatively to foreign fruits. Complimenting their flavor, trying different varieties, or learning about mikan farming traditions is a great way to connect with the heart of Ehime's culture — one sweet bite at a time.": "爱媛被称为\"蜜柑王国\"，这里的蜜柑以甜美多汁闻名。蜜柑不仅是水果，更是温暖、好客和地方自豪感的象征。果汁、果酱、甜点、沐浴品等都能见到蜜柑的身影。请珍惜蜜柑，不要浪费或贬低它的简单，也不要与外国水果作负面比较。赞美其美味、尝试不同品种或了解种植传统，都是体验爱媛文化的好方式。",

    "4. Respect Matsuyama Castle Grounds": "4. 尊重松山城的参观礼仪",
    "Matsuyama Castle is one of Japan's few surviving original castles and a treasured symbol of Ehime's history and pride. Perched on a hill overlooking the city, the castle grounds are not only a major tourist attraction but also a place of quiet beauty and reflection for locals. Visitors are expected to behave respectfully while exploring the site — that means avoiding loud conversations, rough play, or taking silly or disrespectful selfies near historical structures. Walking carefully, appreciating the architecture, and observing signs and rules help preserve the dignity of this cultural landmark. Treating the castle and its surroundings with reverence not only honors the legacy of the past but also ensures that future generations can enjoy its atmosphere of quiet strength and heritage.": "松山城是日本现存为数不多的古城之一，是爱媛历史和自豪的象征。这里不仅是旅游胜地，也是当地人静心休憩的场所。参观时请保持安静，避免喧哗、打闹或在历史建筑前拍摄不雅自拍。请小心行走，欣赏建筑美，遵守规定，共同维护文化遗产的尊严，让后人也能感受其魅力。",

    "4. Kagawa": "4. 香川",
    "1. Udon Manners Matter": "1. 乌冬面的用餐礼仪",
    "Kagawa Prefecture is proudly known as the home of Sanuki udon, a thick and chewy noodle that has become a symbol of the region's identity. For locals, udon isn't just a quick meal — it's a carefully crafted dish that reflects centuries of culinary tradition. When dining at udon shops in Kagawa, there are a few unspoken rules to follow. First, don't rush — even though many shops are casual and self-serve, slurping down your bowl without appreciating the flavor and texture is seen as missing the point. Second, avoid over-seasoning — Sanuki udon is known for its subtle balance of flavors, so adding too much soy sauce, chili flakes, or other condiments before tasting is discouraged. Lastly, treat the staff and other diners with quiet courtesy; these shops are often busy, but the atmosphere remains calm and respectful. By enjoying udon the local way, you're not just eating — you're participating in a beloved part of Kagawa's culture.": "香川以赞岐乌冬面闻名。对当地人来说，乌冬面不仅是快餐，更是传承百年的美食文化。在香川的乌冬面店用餐时，请不要急于吃完，要细细品味其口感和风味。不要一开始就加太多调料，先尝原味。店里常很忙，但请保持安静，礼貌对待店员和其他顾客。用当地的方式享用乌冬面，就是融入香川文化的一部分。",

    "2. Observe Proper Behavior at Local Markets": "2. 地方市场的礼仪",
    "Local markets in Kagawa, especially in cities like Takamatsu and Marugame, are places where community life and fresh produce meet. While they may seem relaxed and friendly — and they are — there are still important manners to follow. Haggling is generally not practiced, unlike in some other countries. Prices are usually fair and fixed, and trying to bargain can make vendors uncomfortable or even offended. Instead, polite greetings, showing genuine interest in products, and thanking sellers go a long way. It's also important not to block narrow aisles or stand too long in front of stalls without buying, as this can disrupt the flow of customers. Taking photos without asking may also be frowned upon. Visiting these markets with quiet curiosity and respect helps preserve the welcoming atmosphere and supports the hardworking locals who make Kagawa's food culture so special.": "高松、丸龟等地的市场是当地生活和新鲜食材的交汇点。这里一般不讲价，价格公道且固定，讨价还价会让摊主不快。请主动打招呼、表达感谢，对商品表现出兴趣。不要堵塞狭窄通道，也不要长时间站在摊位前不买东西。未经允许请勿拍照。安静有礼地参观市场，有助于保持友好氛围，也支持了辛勤的本地人。",

    "3. Respect Contemporary Art on Naoshima and Teshima": "3. 尊重直岛和丰岛的现代艺术",
    "The islands of Naoshima and Teshima in Kagawa Prefecture are internationally renowned for their stunning blend of nature, architecture, and contemporary art. Home to world-class museums like the Chichu Art Museum and Teshima Art Museum, these islands offer immersive experiences that invite quiet reflection rather than casual tourism. Many of the artworks are designed to interact with light, space, and silence — and touching them, leaning on installations, or taking disruptive selfies can damage both the art and the atmosphere. Photography is restricted in many areas, and rules vary depending on the exhibit. Visitors are expected to move slowly, speak softly, and follow all posted guidelines. Treating these islands not just as photo ops, but as places to truly engage with creativity and thought, reflects the respect these artistic sanctuaries deserve.": "香川县的直岛和丰岛以自然、建筑与现代艺术的融合闻名世界。这里有地中美术馆、丰岛美术馆等顶级艺术场所。许多艺术品与光线、空间和静谧互动，切勿触摸、倚靠或喧闹自拍，以免破坏艺术和氛围。许多区域禁止拍照，规则因展览而异。请慢行、低声交谈，遵守所有规定。把这些岛屿当作艺术圣地而非拍照景点，才是真正的尊重。",

    "Yamaguchi's lantern festivals, especially the Tanabata Lantern Festival, are serene and spiritual events that light up the streets with soft, glowing beauty. During these festivals, thousands of handmade lanterns line roads and temple grounds, creating a peaceful and almost sacred atmosphere. While it's natural to want to take photos, pushing through crowds, using flash, or loudly chatting with friends can disrupt the mood that locals work hard to preserve. These festivals are not loud celebrations — they are moments of reflection, tradition, and quiet beauty. Visitors are encouraged to walk slowly, observe silently, and fully absorb the gentle magic of the lantern-lit night.": "山口的灯笼节，尤其是七夕灯笼节，是充满宁静与灵性的活动，柔和的灯光点亮街道，营造出梦幻般的美景。节日期间，成千上万个手工灯笼排列在道路和寺庙周围，营造出安静而神圣的氛围。虽然拍照很自然，但请勿在人群中推搡、使用闪光灯或大声喧哗，这些行为会破坏当地人用心守护的氛围。这些节日并非热闹的庆典，而是反思、传承与静谧美的时刻。建议游客慢慢行走，安静观赏，尽情感受灯火点缀夜晚的温柔魔力。",
    
    "4. Show Respect at Ruriko-ji Temple and Mori Clan Sites": "4. 请以敬意参观瑠璃光寺及毛利家相关遗址",
