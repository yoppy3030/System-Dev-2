    "Introduction to the Hokkaido Region": "北海道地区简介",
    "Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, is a land of breathtaking natural beauty, rich culture, and unique seasonal charm. Known for its vast landscapes, snowy winters, and cool summers, Hokkaido offers a refreshing escape from Japan's more urbanized regions. The island is famous for its winter sports in areas like Niseko and Sapporo, stunning flower fields in Furano, and fresh seafood markets in Hakodate. Beyond its scenic appeal, Hokkaido is home to the indigenous Ainu culture, giving it a distinct heritage and identity within Japan. Whether you're drawn by adventure, cuisine, or serenity, Hokkaido welcomes visitors with wide open spaces and warm local hospitality.": "北海道是日本最北端的岛屿，拥有令人叹为观止的自然美景、丰富的文化和独特的季节魅力。以其广阔的景观、多雪的冬季和凉爽的夏季而闻名，北海道为游客提供了一个远离日本城市化地区的清新去处。该岛以新雪谷和札幌等地区的冬季运动、富良野绚丽的花田以及函馆新鲜的海鲜市场而闻名。除了其风景魅力之外，北海道还是土著阿伊努文化的发源地，这使其在日本拥有独特的传统和身份。无论您是被冒险、美食还是宁静所吸引，北海道都以其广阔的空间和热情的当地好客精神欢迎游客。",

    "Sapporo": "札幌",
    "1. Don't Walk on Uncleared Snow Paths Without Caution": "1. 除非有把握，否则不要在未清理的雪路上行走",
    "In Sapporo, where winters are long and snowy, locals have an unspoken rule when it comes to walking through the city — always avoid uncleared snow paths unless you know what you're doing. While visitors might be tempted to walk through fresh snow or take shortcuts, longtime residents understand that these areas can hide dangerous layers of ice underneath. Many sidewalks are regularly maintained and sprinkled with gravel or salt to prevent slipping, and locals instinctively stick to those routes. Walking on untreated paths not only risks injury but also shows a lack of awareness of the winter culture in Sapporo. To move safely like a local, watch where people walk — and follow their footprints.": "在冬长雪多的札幌，当地人在城市中行走时有一个不成文的规定——除非你知道自己在做什么，否则一定要避开未清理的雪路。虽然游客可能会想穿越新雪或走捷径，但老居民们知道这些区域下面可能隐藏着危险的冰层。许多人行道会定期维护并撒上沙砾或盐以防滑，当地人会本能地选择这些路线。在未经处理的路上行走不仅有受伤的风险，也显示出对札幌冬季文化的不了解。要像当地人一样安全行动，请观察人们走在哪里——并跟随他们的脚印。",

    "2. Umbrellas Are Useless in Sapporo Snow": "2. 在札幌的雪天里雨伞是没用的",
    "In Sapporo, using an umbrella during snowfall is seen as unnecessary — and even a little strange. Unlike rain, the snow in Sapporo is often light, dry, and powdery, especially during the colder months. Locals know that umbrellas don't help much in these conditions and only get in the way. Instead, people rely on warm coats with hoods, knit hats, and waterproof outerwear to stay dry and comfortable. Visitors who walk around with umbrellas in the snow often stand out as tourists, while seasoned locals simply brush off the flakes and keep walking. If you want to blend in and move smoothly through the city, ditch the umbrella and embrace the snow like a true Sapporo native.": "在札幌，下雪时打伞被认为是不必要的，甚至有点奇怪。与雨不同，札幌的雪通常是轻、干、粉状的，尤其是在较冷的月份。当地人知道，在这些情况下雨伞帮不上什么忙，只会碍事。相反，人们依靠带兜帽的暖和外套、针织帽和防水外衣来保持干爽舒适。在雪中打着伞四处走动的游客往往会显得像游客，而经验丰富的当地人只是拍掉雪花继续前行。如果你想融入其中并顺利地在城市中穿行，那就扔掉雨伞，像真正的札幌本地人一样拥抱雪吧。",

    "3. Don't Walk Indoors with Snowy Shoes": "3. 不要穿着带雪的鞋子在室内行走",
    "In Sapporo, where heavy snowfall is a part of daily life, it's considered very rude to walk indoors with snowy or wet shoes. Locals take great care to keep indoor spaces clean and dry, especially in winter. When entering homes, restaurants, small shops, or traditional inns, people are expected to either remove their shoes or properly stomp off the snow outside on a mat. Many places even provide slippers or indoor shoes near the entrance. Bringing slush and snow inside not only makes a mess but can also be dangerous, as wet floors become slippery. Paying attention to your footwear and following what locals do is a simple but important way to show respect for Sapporo's winter lifestyle.": "在札幌，大雪是日常生活的一部分，穿着带雪或湿的鞋子进入室内被认为是非常不礼貌的。当地人非常注意保持室内空间的清洁和干燥，尤其是在冬天。进入住宅、餐馆、小商店或传统旅馆时，人们应该脱鞋或在室外的垫子上把雪跺掉。许多地方甚至在入口附近提供拖鞋或室内鞋。将泥泞和雪带入室内不仅会弄得一团糟，而且由于地面湿滑也可能很危险。注意你的鞋子并遵循当地人的做法，是表达对札幌冬季生活方式尊重的一种简单而重要的方式。",

    "4. Don't Block People for Photos During Festivals": "4. 节日期间不要为了拍照而挡住别人",
    "During popular festivals in Sapporo, like the Sapporo Snow Festival, it's common to see beautiful displays and sculptures that everyone wants to photograph. However, locals value smooth movement and shared enjoyment of public space. Standing too long in front of a snow sculpture, blocking a narrow path, or taking selfies in the middle of a busy crowd can be frustrating for others. People in Sapporo quietly wait their turn, take their photos quickly, and move aside to let others enjoy the view. Being aware of your surroundings and not blocking the flow of people is an important part of festival manners — it shows respect for both the event and everyone attending.": "在札幌雪祭等热门节日期间，经常可以看到每个人都想拍照的美丽展品和雕塑。然而，当地人非常重视公共空间的顺畅流动和共同享用。在雪雕前站立过久、堵塞狭窄的通道，或在拥挤的人群中自拍，都可能让其他人感到困扰。札幌人会安静地排队等候，迅速拍照，然后移到一旁，让其他人也能欣赏。注意周围环境，不阻碍人流，是重要的节日礼仪——这既表示对活动的尊重，也表示对所有参与者的尊重。",

    "Hakodate": "函馆",
    "1. Don't Be Loud at Mount Hakodate Night View": "1. 在函馆山观赏夜景时不要大声喧哗",
    "Mount Hakodate offers one of the most stunning night views in Japan, attracting both locals and tourists with its glittering panorama of the city and coastline. However, this scenic spot is also known for its quiet, peaceful atmosphere. Locals visit the mountaintop to relax, reflect, or enjoy a quiet moment with friends or loved ones. Speaking loudly, playing music, or making noise disrupts this special ambiance and can be seen as disrespectful. Tourists are expected to speak softly, avoid blocking others' views, and take photos quickly and politely. By keeping the atmosphere calm and respectful, you'll not only blend in with the locals but also fully appreciate the beauty that makes this place so special.": "函馆山提供日本最令人惊叹的夜景之一，以其闪烁的城市和海岸线全景吸引着当地人和游客。然而，这个风景点也以其安静、平和的氛围而闻名。当地人到山顶放松、反思，或与朋友、爱人享受宁静的时刻。大声说话、播放音乐或制造噪音会破坏这种特殊氛围，并可能被视为不尊重。游客应轻声说话，避免遮挡他人视线，并迅速而有礼貌地拍照。通过保持安静和尊重的氛围，您不仅能融入当地人，还能充分享受这个地方如此特别的美丽。",

    "2. Don't Take Photos Inside Temples or Churches Without Permission": "2. 未经许可，请勿在寺庙或教堂内拍照",
    "Hakodate is known for its rare mix of historic temples, Shinto shrines, and old Western-style churches — a reflection of its international past. While many of these places are open to visitors, they are still active sites of worship and quiet reflection for the local community. Taking photos inside without permission can be seen as intrusive or disrespectful, especially during prayer times or religious ceremonies. Some places may allow photography in certain areas, but others clearly prohibit it with signs — so it's important to look carefully and ask if you're unsure. Showing respect by following these quiet rules not only honors the traditions of Hakodate, but also leaves a good impression as a thoughtful guest.": "函馆以其历史悠久的寺庙、神社和古老的西式教堂的罕见组合而闻名——这反映了其国际化的过去。虽然这些地方大多对游客开放，但它们仍然是当地社区进行礼拜和静思的活跃场所。未经许可在室内拍照可能被视为侵扰或不尊重，尤其是在祈祷时间或宗教仪式期间。有些地方可能允许在特定区域拍照，但其他地方则明确标示禁止——因此仔细查看并在不确定时询问非常重要。通过遵守这些安静的规则来表示尊重，不仅尊重了函馆的传统，也作为一位体贴的客人留下了良好的印象。",

    "3. Don't Ignore Streetcar Etiquette": "3. 不要忽视有轨电车的礼仪",
    "The streetcars in Hakodate are not just a mode of transportation — they're a part of daily life and local culture. Riding the streetcar comes with unspoken rules that locals naturally follow. Passengers line up quietly, board in order, and keep conversations soft and respectful. Seats are often offered to the elderly, people with disabilities, and parents with children, and it's polite to avoid occupying priority seats unless necessary. Loud talking, phone calls, or playing music without headphones is considered bad manners. Visitors who respect this quiet, orderly style of commuting show that they care about the local way of life and help maintain the peaceful atmosphere that Hakodate residents value.": "函馆的有轨电车不仅是一种交通工具——它们是日常生活和当地文化的一部分。乘坐有轨电车有一些当地人自然遵循的潜规则。乘客安静排队，按顺序上车，并保持轻声和尊重的交谈。座位通常会让给老人、残疾人和带孩子的父母，除非必要，否则礼貌上应避免占用优先座位。大声交谈、打电话或不戴耳机播放音乐被认为是失礼行为。尊重这种安静、有序的通勤方式的游客表明他们关心当地的生活方式，并有助于维持函馆居民所珍视的和平氛围。",

    "4.Don't Waste the Fresh Seafood at the Morning Market": "4. 不要浪费早市的新鲜海鲜",
    "Hakodate's Morning Market (朝市) is famous across Japan for its incredibly fresh seafood, especially squid, sea urchin, crab, and scallops. For locals, this food isn't just a meal — it represents hard work, tradition, and pride in the local fishing culture. When tourists order seafood, especially live or freshly prepared dishes, it's expected that they eat it with appreciation and finish what they take. Leaving large amounts uneaten or treating rare seafood like a novelty for photos can seem disrespectful to both the chefs and fishermen. To show proper respect in Hakodate, enjoy the food sincerely, and avoid ordering more than you can eat.": "函馆的早市（朝市）以其极其新鲜的海鲜闻名全日本，特别是鱿鱼、海胆、螃蟹和扇贝。对当地人来说，这食物不仅仅是一顿饭——它代表着辛勤工作、传统和对当地渔业文化的自豪。当游客点海鲜，特别是活的或新鲜烹制的海鲜时，希望他们能怀着感激之情享用并吃完所点的食物。剩下大量食物或将稀有海鲜当作拍照的新奇玩意儿，可能对厨师和渔民都显得不尊重。在函馆表示应有的尊重，请真诚地享用美食，并避免点超过自己食量的食物。",

    "5. Don't Be Disrespectful at Historical Sites": "5. 不要在历史古迹处失礼",
    "Hakodate is rich in historical landmarks, from the star-shaped Goryokaku Fort to old consulates, traditional warehouses, and Western-style churches. These places aren't just tourist attractions — they hold deep cultural and historical meaning for the local people. Climbing on old stone walls, touching fragile displays, speaking loudly, or behaving casually in sacred or preserved spaces can come across as careless or disrespectful. Visitors are expected to move calmly, follow posted rules, and treat these sites with the same care locals do. Showing quiet respect at historical locations helps preserve their beauty and meaning for future generations — and shows that you value Hakodate's unique past.": "函馆拥有丰富的历史地标，从星形的五棱郭堡到旧领事馆、传统仓库和西式教堂。这些地方不仅仅是旅游景点——它们对当地人具有深刻的文化和历史意义。在古老的石墙上攀爬、触摸易碎的展品、大声说话或在神圣或受保护的空间内行为随意，都可能被视为粗心或不尊重。游客应平静地移动，遵守张贴的规则，并像当地人一样爱护这些遗址。在历史地点表现出安静的尊重，有助于为后代保护它们的美丽和意义——并表明您珍视函馆独特的过去。",

    "Obihiro": "带广",
    "1. Don't Treat Banei Horse Racing Like a Joke": "1. 不要把\"ばんえい\"赛马当成笑话",
    "Banei horse racing is one of Obihiro's most cherished cultural traditions — and the only place in the world where it exists. Unlike regular horse racing, Banei involves massive draft horses pulling heavy sleds across a dirt track with hills, showcasing strength, endurance, and deep trust between horse and rider. For locals, this isn't just entertainment — it's a proud symbol of Tokachi's farming heritage and a tribute to the horses that once supported Hokkaido's development. Tourists who laugh at the slow pace, cheer too loudly, or make jokes about the horses may unknowingly offend the people who take this tradition to heart. Visitors are encouraged to watch with respect, learn about its history, and feel the quiet power behind this one-of-a-kind event.": "ばんえい赛马是带广最珍贵的文化传统之一，也是世界上唯一存在这种赛马的地方。与普通赛马不同，ばんえい赛马是由巨大的挽马在带坡的泥土赛道上拉着沉重的雪橇，展示马匹的力量、耐力和骑手与马之间深厚的信任。对当地人来说，这不仅仅是娱乐——它是十胜农业遗产的骄傲象征，也是对曾经支持北海道发展的马匹的致敬。嘲笑比赛节奏缓慢、过分大声欢呼或拿马开玩笑的游客，可能会在不知不觉中冒犯那些珍视这一传统的人们。鼓励游客怀着敬意观看，了解其历史，并感受这一独一无二活动背后的静谧力量。",

    "2. Don't Pick or Step Into Farmlands": "2. 不要采摘或踏入农田",
    "Obihiro is surrounded by some of the most productive farmland in Japan, making agriculture a central part of daily life and local pride. The wide, open fields filled with potatoes, corn, wheat, and beans might look like beautiful photo spots, but they are actually private property and active workspaces. Some tourists may be tempted to step into the fields for photos or even pick crops, but this is strictly forbidden and seen as deeply disrespectful. Not only does it damage the plants and soil, but it also disrupts the hard work of local farmers. Visitors are welcome to enjoy the scenic views from a distance, but it's important to respect the boundaries of the land and the people who care for it every day.": "带广被日本一些最高产的农田所环绕，农业是日常生活和当地自豪感的核心部分。宽阔的田野里种满了土豆、玉米、小麦和豆类，可能看起来像美丽的照片拍摄地，但它们实际上是私人财产和活跃的工作区。一些游客可能会想进入田地拍照甚至采摘庄稼，但这是严格禁止的，并被视为极大的不尊重。这不仅会损害植物和土壤，还会扰乱当地农民的辛勤工作。欢迎游客从远处欣赏风景，但尊重土地的边界和每天照料它的人们非常重要。",

    "3. Don't Waste Your Butadon": "3. 不要浪费你的猪肉盖饭",
    "Obihiro is the proud birthplace of Butadon — a delicious rice bowl topped with grilled pork and sweet-savory sauce. This dish isn't just a local specialty; it represents the region's rich agricultural culture and high-quality pork production. For locals, Butadon is comfort food with deep meaning, often linked to family meals and regional pride. When tourists order Butadon and leave most of it uneaten, it can feel disrespectful — especially in a place where people value food deeply and understand the effort behind every ingredient. To show appreciation, visitors should only order what they can finish and take time to enjoy the flavor and care that goes into every bowl.": "带广是猪肉盖饭（Butadon）的骄傲发源地——这是一种美味的米饭，上面铺着烤猪肉和甜咸酱汁。这道菜不仅仅是当地的特产；它代表了该地区丰富的农业文化和高质量的猪肉生产。对当地人来说，猪肉盖饭是具有深刻意义的舒适食品，常常与家庭聚餐和地区自豪感联系在一起。当游客点了猪肉盖饭却剩下大部分不吃时，会让人觉得不尊重——尤其是在一个人们非常珍惜食物并理解每种食材背后辛劳的地方。为了表示感谢，游客应该只点自己能吃完的份量，并花时间品味每碗饭的风味和用心。",

    "4. Don't Block Rural Roads or Farm Paths": "4. 不要堵塞乡间道路或农用小径",
    "In the scenic countryside around Obihiro, it's common for visitors to stop and admire the beautiful farmland, wide skies, and mountain views. However, many of the roads and narrow lanes that pass through these areas are active farm routes used daily by tractors, delivery trucks, and local workers. Parking a car or standing for photos in the middle of these paths — even just for a few minutes — can interrupt important agricultural work or create dangerous situations. Unlike in cities, these roads may not have clear signs or sidewalks, but they are essential for the community. Visitors should always park in designated areas and be mindful not to block entrances, driveways, or narrow lanes. Respecting these small but vital routes shows appreciation for the land and the people who sustain it.": "在带广周围风景优美的乡村，游客常常停下来欣赏美丽的农田、广阔的天空和山景。然而，穿过这些地区的许多道路和狭窄小巷都是拖拉机、送货卡车和当地工人每天使用的农用路线。在这些道路中间停车或站着拍照——即使只有几分钟——也可能中断重要的农业工作或造成危险情况。与城市不同，这些道路可能没有清晰的标志或人行道，但它们对社区至关重要。游客应始终在指定区域停车，并注意不要堵塞入口、车道或狭窄小巷。尊重这些虽小但至关重要的路线，表明了对土地和维持它的人们的感激之情。",

    "Asahikawa": "旭川",
    "1. Don't Underestimate the Cold Weather": "1. 不要低估寒冷的天气",
    "Asahikawa is known for being one of the coldest cities in Japan, with winter temperatures often dropping below –20°C. For locals, dealing with extreme cold is a normal part of life — they're well-prepared with insulated clothing, winter boots, heat packs, and layered outfits. However, tourists sometimes underestimate just how harsh the weather can be, especially when arriving from warmer regions. Wearing light jackets, thin shoes, or forgetting gloves can lead to discomfort or even minor frostbite. To avoid problems, visitors should take the cold seriously and dress properly. Being prepared not only keeps you warm and safe, but also shows respect for the local environment and culture.": "旭川是日本最寒冷的城市之一，冬季气温常降至–20°C以下。对当地人来说，应对严寒是生活的一部分——他们准备了保暖衣物、冬靴、暖宝宝和多层服装。然而，游客有时会低估天气的严酷性，尤其是从温暖地区来的时候。穿着轻薄夹克、薄鞋或忘记戴手套可能会导致不适甚至轻微冻伤。为避免问题，游客应认真对待寒冷并穿着得当。做好准备不仅能保暖安全，也体现了对当地环境和文化的尊重。",

    "2. Don't Disrupt Local Theater or Art Spaces": "2. 不要打扰当地的剧院或艺术空间",
    "Asahikawa has a surprisingly vibrant arts and theater scene for a regional city, with local galleries, small theaters, and cultural centers that reflect the community's deep appreciation for creativity. These spaces are often intimate and quiet, designed to let visitors fully engage with performances or exhibitions. Tourists who talk loudly, take phone calls, or use flash photography can unintentionally disturb the atmosphere and show a lack of consideration. Even casual behavior like leaning on gallery pieces or eating inside the venue may be seen as disrespectful. If you choose to visit these cultural spots, it's best to follow the lead of locals: stay quiet, observe carefully, and enjoy the art with thoughtful attention.": "作为一个地区性城市，旭川拥有令人惊讶的充满活力的艺术和戏剧场景，当地的画廊、小剧院和文化中心反映了社区对创造力的深刻欣赏。这些空间通常是私密而安静的，旨在让游客完全沉浸在表演或展览中。大声交谈、接听电话或使用闪光灯拍照的游客可能会无意中打扰气氛，表现出缺乏考虑。即使是像靠在画廊展品上或在场馆内吃东西这样的随意行为，也可能被视为不尊重。如果您选择参观这些文化场所，最好跟随当地人的做法：保持安静，仔细观察，并用心欣赏艺术。",

    "3.Don't Treat the Asahiyama Zoo Like a Theme Park": "3. 不要把旭山动物园当成主题公园",
    "The Asahiyama Zoo is one of Asahikawa's most beloved attractions, not just for tourists but also for locals who take great pride in its thoughtful, animal-friendly design. Unlike flashy theme parks, this zoo is known for its \"behavioral exhibitions,\" which allow animals to move naturally and be observed in ways that reflect their true habits. It's a place of learning, not entertainment. Tourists who shout at animals, tap on glass, or treat the zoo like a playground may disrupt the peaceful environment and upset both staff and other visitors. Respecting the animals by watching quietly and following posted rules helps preserve the special atmosphere that makes Asahiyama Zoo such a meaningful place for the community.": "旭山动物园是旭川最受欢迎的景点之一，不仅对游客如此，对当地人也是如此，他们对其周到、动物友好的设计感到非常自豪。与华丽的主题公园不同，这个动物园以其\"行为展览\"而闻名，这些展览让动物能够自然地活动，并以反映其真实习性的方式被观察。这是一个学习的地方，而不是娱乐场所。对动物大喊大叫、敲打玻璃或把动物园当成游乐场的游客，可能会破坏宁静的环境，让工作人员和其他游客感到不安。通过安静地观察和遵守张贴的规则来尊重动物，有助于保护使旭山动物园成为社区如此有意义的地方的特殊氛围。",

    "4. Don't Ignore the Value of Local Craftsmanship": "4. 不要忽视当地手工艺的价值",
    "Asahikawa is renowned across Japan for its high-quality woodcraft and furniture design, with a long tradition of skilled craftsmanship passed down through generations. Many local workshops and galleries feature beautifully made chairs, tables, and everyday items that reflect a deep respect for materials and detail. However, some visitors may overlook the value of these items, treating them as simple souvenirs or testing furniture in showrooms without permission. Sitting roughly, touching displays carelessly, or treating handmade pieces like mass-produced goods can offend artisans and staff who take great pride in their work. To truly appreciate Asahikawa's craftsmanship, visitors should observe with care, ask questions respectfully, and understand the passion behind each creation.": "旭川以其高品质的木工和家具设计在日本闻名，拥有世代相传的精湛工艺传统。许多当地的工作坊和画廊展示着制作精美的椅子、桌子和日常用品，反映了对材料和细节的深刻尊重。然而，一些游客可能会忽视这些物品的价值，把它们当作简单的纪念品，或未经允许在陈列室试用家具。粗鲁地坐下、不小心触摸展品，或把手工作品当作批量生产的商品，都可能冒犯那些以自己的工作为荣的工匠和工作人员。要真正欣赏旭川的手工艺，游客应该仔细观察，恭敬地提问，并理解每个创作背后的热情。",
