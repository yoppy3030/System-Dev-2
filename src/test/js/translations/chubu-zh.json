    "Introduction to the Chubu Region": "中部地区介绍",
    "The Chūbu Region, meaning \"central region,\" lies in the very heart of Japan's main island, Honshu, bridging the bustling cities of Kanto in the east and the cultural traditions of Kansai in the west. Known for its dramatic contrasts, Chūbu stretches from the rugged peaks of the Japanese Alps to the serene coastline along the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. The region includes nine diverse prefectures—from industrial hubs like Aichi (home to Toyota) to spiritual centers like Nagano and historic towns like Kanazawa in Ishikawa. Chūbu is famous for its natural beauty, traditional craftsmanship, unique local foods, and deep-rooted mountain culture. Whether you're skiing in Nagano, soaking in an onsen in Gifu, exploring miso factories in Aichi, or hiking through sacred forests in Yamanashi, the Chūbu Region offers a rich, authentic slice of Japan that blends history, nature, and innovation.": "中部地区意为\"中央地区\"，位于日本主岛本州的中心地带，连接东部的关东繁华城市和西部的关西文化传统。中部地区以其戏剧性的对比而闻名，从日本阿尔卑斯山的崎岖山峰延伸到日本海和太平洋沿岸的宁静海岸线。该地区包括九个不同的县——从爱知（丰田总部所在地）等工业中心到长野等精神中心，以及石川金泽等历史城镇。中部地区以其自然美景、传统工艺、独特的当地美食和深厚的山地文化而闻名。无论您是在长野滑雪、在岐阜泡温泉、探索爱知的味噌工厂，还是在山梨的神圣森林中徒步旅行，中部地区都提供了融合历史、自然和创新的丰富而真实的日本体验。",

    "Chubu region": "中部地区",

    "1. Nagano": "1. 长野",
    "1. Don't Treat Zenkoji Like a Tourist Attraction Only": "1. 不要只把善光寺当作旅游景点",
    "While Zenkoji Temple in Nagano is a popular sightseeing spot, it remains one of Japan's most sacred and active places of worship. Many visitors come not just to look around, but to pray, reflect, and follow centuries-old rituals. Tourists should be mindful of their behavior — walking quietly, avoiding selfies in sacred spaces, and showing respect by bowing at the temple gate. It's also customary to experience the \"okaidan meguri,\" a symbolic journey in complete darkness beneath the main hall, meant to purify the soul. Approaching Zenkoji with the same reverence as the pilgrims who travel there will lead to a more meaningful and respectful visit.": "虽然长野的善光寺是一个受欢迎的观光景点，但它仍然是日本最神圣和最活跃的礼拜场所之一。许多游客不仅来参观，还来祈祷、冥想和遵循数百年历史的仪式。游客应该注意自己的行为——安静地行走，避免在神圣空间自拍，并在寺庙门口鞠躬以示尊重。体验\"御戒坛巡礼\"也是传统，这是在本堂下方完全黑暗中进行的象征性旅程，旨在净化灵魂。以与前往那里的朝圣者相同的敬畏之心接近善光寺，将带来更有意义和尊重的访问。",

    "2. Don't Feed or Touch the Snow Monkeys": "2. 不要喂食或触摸雪猴",
    "At Jigokudani Monkey Park in Nagano, the sight of wild Japanese macaques relaxing in hot springs is truly unforgettable — but it's important to remember that these monkeys are not pets or performers. They come and go freely, and locals work hard to protect their natural behavior. Tourists should never try to feed, touch, or provoke them for photos, as this can cause stress, aggression, or even disrupt their delicate ecosystem. Getting too close or making loud noises may also make them feel threatened. The best way to enjoy this rare and peaceful scene is to observe quietly and respectfully from a safe distance.": "在长野的地狱谷野猴公园，野生日本猕猴在温泉中放松的景象确实令人难忘——但重要的是要记住这些猴子不是宠物或表演者。它们自由来去，当地人努力保护它们的自然行为。游客绝不应该为了拍照而试图喂食、触摸或挑衅它们，因为这可能导致压力、攻击性，甚至破坏它们脆弱的生态系统。靠得太近或发出大声噪音也可能让它们感到威胁。享受这种罕见而宁静景象的最佳方式是从安全距离安静而尊重地观察。",

    "3. Don't Pick Fruit Without Permission": "3. 未经许可不要采摘水果",
    "Nagano is famous for its delicious apples, grapes, and other seasonal fruits, and you'll often see orchards and farms lining the countryside. While it may be tempting to reach out and grab a ripe apple or bunch of grapes, doing so without permission is considered trespassing and disrespectful. These fruits are carefully grown by local farmers and are part of their livelihood. Many orchards offer fruit-picking experiences, but only in designated areas and with payment. If you'd like to try picking fruit, look for signs that say \"果物狩り OK\" or ask staff politely. Always treat farmland with the same respect you would a private home.": "长野以其美味的苹果、葡萄和其他季节性水果而闻名，您经常可以看到果园和农场排列在乡村。虽然伸手摘一个成熟的苹果或一串葡萄可能很诱人，但未经许可这样做被认为是非法侵入和不尊重的。这些水果由当地农民精心种植，是他们生计的一部分。许多果园提供水果采摘体验，但只在指定区域并需付费。如果您想尝试采摘水果，请寻找写着\"果物狩り OK\"的标志或礼貌地向工作人员询问。始终以对待私人住宅的相同尊重来对待农田。",

    "4. Don't Take Part in the Onbashira Festival Lightly": "4. 不要轻率地参加御柱祭",
    "Held once every six years in the Suwa region of Nagano, the Onbashira Festival is one of Japan's most thrilling and sacred events. Participants ride massive tree trunks down steep slopes and pull them through towns to re-erect at Suwa Taisha Shrine. While it might look like an adventurous and exciting spectacle, the festival is deeply rooted in Shinto beliefs and local pride, and it involves real physical danger. Tourists should never try to join on a whim or treat it as a fun stunt — injuries and even fatalities have occurred. Instead, visitors are encouraged to watch from safe zones, learn about the spiritual meaning behind the rituals, and show deep respect for the bravery and tradition of the local people who carry it out.": "在长野诹访地区每六年举行一次的御柱祭是日本最刺激和最神圣的活动之一。参与者骑着巨大的树干从陡峭的斜坡滑下，并将它们拉过城镇重新竖立在诹访大社。虽然它可能看起来像一场冒险和刺激的奇观，但这个节日深深植根于神道信仰和当地自豪感，涉及真正的身体危险。游客绝不应该一时兴起尝试参加或将其视为有趣的表演——已经发生过伤害甚至死亡事件。相反，鼓励游客从安全区域观看，了解仪式背后的精神意义，并对执行仪式的当地人的勇气和传统表示深深的尊重。",

    "5. Don't Skip the Bow at Shrines (Especially at Togakushi and Suwa)": "5. 不要在神社省略鞠躬（特别是在户隐和诹访）",
    "In Nagano, shrines like Togakushi Shrine and Suwa Taisha are not just beautiful landmarks — they are sacred places deeply connected to nature, history, and spirituality. When visiting, it's important to follow basic Shinto etiquette. Always bow once before entering the torii gate, walk along the sides of the path (never down the center, which is reserved for the gods), and bow again when you leave. This simple act of respect shows your understanding of local customs and helps preserve the spiritual atmosphere of the site. Skipping the bow or behaving too casually, especially at these spiritually important shrines, may come across as disrespectful to both the place and the people who care for it.": "在长野，像户隐神社和诹访大社这样的神社不仅仅是美丽的地标——它们是深深连接自然、历史和灵性的神圣场所。参观时，遵循基本的神道礼仪很重要。在进入鸟居门之前总是鞠躬一次，沿着道路两侧行走（决不要走中央，那是为神灵保留的），离开时再次鞠躬。这种简单的尊重行为表明您对当地习俗的理解，并有助于保持场所的精神氛围。省略鞠躬或表现得过于随意，特别是在这些精神上重要的神社，可能对场所和照顾它的人都显得不尊重。",

    "2. Aichi": "2. 爱知",
    "1. Don't Call Hatcho Miso \"Too Strong\"": "1. 不要称八丁味噌\"太浓\"",
    "Hatcho miso is a deep, dark red miso that's been fermented for over two years — a specialty of Aichi, especially in Okazaki. Its rich, bold flavor is very different from the lighter miso used in other parts of Japan, and locals are incredibly proud of it. Dishes like miso katsu or miso nikomi udon are made with this strong miso base, and they represent the heart of the region's culinary identity. Even if the taste is unusual or intense for some visitors, it's important not to criticize it openly by saying things like \"too strong\" or \"too salty.\" Instead, show interest or appreciation, as this miso reflects generations of tradition and pride in Aichi's food culture.": "八丁味噌是一种发酵超过两年的深红黑色味噌——爱知的特产，特别是在冈崎。其浓郁、大胆的味道与日本其他地方使用的清淡味噌非常不同，当地人对此非常自豪。像味噌炸猪排或味噌煮乌冬面这样的菜肴都是用这种浓味噌制作的，它们代表了该地区烹饪身份的核心。即使味道对某些游客来说不寻常或强烈，重要的是不要通过说\"太浓\"或\"太咸\"之类的话来公开批评它。相反，表现出兴趣或欣赏，因为这种味噌反映了爱知饮食文化中几代人的传统和自豪感。",

    "2. Don't Eat Tebasaki (Chicken Wings) Carelessly": "2. 不要随意吃手羽先（鸡翅）",
    "Tebasaki — seasoned, crispy chicken wings — are one of Aichi's most iconic local dishes, especially popular in Nagoya's izakayas like Yamachan and Furaibo. Unlike typical wings, tebasaki are eaten with a specific technique: twisting the bone and pulling the meat off cleanly with your hands. Locals take pride in eating them neatly and savoring the flavor. Tourists should avoid picking at them messily, leaving bones half-eaten, or complaining about the sticky hands — it's all part of the fun and flavor. Watching how locals eat and giving it a respectful try is the best way to enjoy this Nagoya specialty.": "手羽先——调味酥脆的鸡翅——是爱知最具标志性的当地菜肴之一，在名古屋的居酒屋如山ちゃん和风来坊特别受欢迎。与典型的鸡翅不同，手羽先需要用特定技术食用：扭转骨头，用手干净地撕下肉。当地人以整洁地食用和品味味道为荣。游客应该避免乱挑、留下半吃的骨头或抱怨手粘——这都是乐趣和味道的一部分。观察当地人如何食用并尊重地尝试是享受这种名古屋特产的最佳方式。",

    "3. Don't Mishandle Karakuri Puppets": "3. 不要不当处理机关人偶",
    "Karakuri puppets are traditional mechanical dolls that originate from Aichi, especially in cities like Inuyama and Nagoya. These beautifully crafted figures are powered by springs and gears — no electricity — and can perform complex movements such as serving tea or dancing. Far from being simple toys, they are a treasured part of Aichi's craftsmanship culture and often appear in local festivals and exhibitions. Tourists should avoid touching the puppets, leaning in too close for photos, or comparing them casually to robots or anime figures. Mishandling or underestimating their cultural value may come across as disrespectful. Observing with care and curiosity shows appreciation for the incredible artistry behind these living traditions.": "机关人偶是起源于爱知的传统机械人偶，特别是在犬山和名古屋等城市。这些精美制作的人偶由弹簧和齿轮驱动——不使用电力——可以执行复杂的动作，如端茶或跳舞。它们远非简单的玩具，而是爱知工艺文化的珍贵部分，经常出现在当地节日和展览中。游客应该避免触摸人偶、为了拍照靠得太近，或将它们随意与机器人或动漫人物比较。不当处理或低估其文化价值可能显得不尊重。以关心和好奇心观察表明对这些活传统背后令人难以置信的艺术性的欣赏。",

    "4. Don't Treat Ebi Senbei as Just \"Snacks\"": "4. 不要只把虾仙贝当作\"零食\"",
    "Ebi senbei — shrimp-flavored rice crackers — are a beloved specialty of Aichi, especially in coastal areas like Mikawa and Chita. While they may look like simple snacks, these crackers are often handmade with local shrimp and come in a wide range of flavors, textures, and packaging designs. For locals, ebi senbei are not just something to eat casually — they're a popular form of omiyage (souvenir gift), meant to be shared with friends, coworkers, or family after a trip. Treating them like cheap junk food or tossing them aside without trying them can come off as rude. Respecting them as a thoughtful and meaningful gift shows good manners and appreciation for Aichi's local traditions.": "虾仙贝——虾味米饼——是爱知深受喜爱的特产，特别是在三河和知多等沿海地区。虽然它们可能看起来像简单的零食，但这些米饼通常用当地虾手工制作，有多种口味、质地和包装设计。对当地人来说，虾仙贝不仅仅是随意食用的东西——它们是お土産（纪念礼物）的流行形式，旨在旅行后与朋友、同事或家人分享。将它们当作便宜的垃圾食品或试都不试就扔在一边可能显得粗鲁。将它们作为体贴和有意义的礼物来尊重表明良好的礼仪和对爱知当地传统的欣赏。",

    "3. Shizuoka": "3. 静冈",
    "1. Don't Walk Through Tea Fields or Touch the Leaves Without Permission": "1. 未经许可不要在茶园行走或触摸茶叶",
    "Shizuoka is Japan's largest tea producer, and tea farms are often mistaken for open tourist spaces. In reality, they are carefully maintained by farmers. Walking into the rows, picking leaves, or stepping on the soil damages the crop and disrespects the growers. Unless you are in a guided tour area, stay on marked paths and never enter the fields freely.": "静冈是日本最大的茶叶生产地，茶园经常被误认为是开放的旅游空间。实际上，它们由农民精心维护。走进茶行、采摘叶子或踩踏土壤会损害作物并对种植者不尊重。除非您在导游区域，否则请留在标记的小径上，决不要随意进入田地。",

    "2. Don't Add Too Much Wasabi or Soy Sauce": "2. 不要加太多芥末或酱油",
    "Shizuoka is famous for producing the highest quality fresh wasabi in Japan, as well as top-grade seafood like tuna, sakura shrimp, and shirasu (whitebait). When enjoying local sushi or sashimi, it's important to use condiments with care. Smothering your food with soy sauce or piling on wasabi is considered bad manners — and can even offend the chef. Fresh wasabi has a delicate, clean flavor that's meant to enhance, not overpower, the taste of the fish. The local custom is to add just a small amount, or let the chef apply it for you. Using sauces modestly shows respect for the ingredients, the chef's skill, and Shizuoka's proud food culture.": "静冈以生产日本最高品质的新鲜芥末以及金枪鱼、樱花虾和白鱼等顶级海鲜而闻名。享用当地寿司或生鱼片时，谨慎使用调味料很重要。用酱油覆盖食物或堆叠芥末被认为是坏习惯——甚至可能冒犯厨师。新鲜芥末具有精致、清爽的味道，旨在增强而不是压倒鱼的味道。当地习俗是只添加少量，或让厨师为您添加。适度使用酱料表明对食材、厨师技能和静冈自豪的饮食文化的尊重。",

    "3. Don't Take Photos of Farmers Without Permission": "3. 未经许可不要给农民拍照",
    "In Shizuoka, you'll often see tea farmers working in scenic green fields or fishermen busy in coastal towns — and while these scenes may seem picture-perfect, they are part of people's real, everyday lives. It's important to remember that farmers and workers are not tourist attractions. Taking photos without asking can feel intrusive or disrespectful, especially in rural areas where privacy is valued. If you wish to capture a moment, simply offer a polite gesture or ask with a smile — many locals will happily agree if approached respectfully. Showing this courtesy honors their hard work and helps preserve trust between visitors and the community.": "在静冈，您经常可以看到茶农在风景如画的绿色田野中工作，或渔民在沿海城镇忙碌——虽然这些场景可能看起来完美如画，但它们是人们真实日常生活的一部分。重要的是要记住农民和工人不是旅游景点。未经询问就拍照可能显得侵入或不尊重，特别是在重视隐私的农村地区。如果您想捕捉一个瞬间，只需提供礼貌的手势或微笑询问——如果以尊重的方式接近，许多当地人会很乐意同意。表现出这种礼貌是对他们辛勤工作的尊重，并有助于保持游客与社区之间的信任。",

    "4. Don't Treat Mt. Fuji Like a Simple Tourist Hike": "4. 不要将富士山当作简单的旅游徒步",
    "Mount Fuji, especially from the Shizuoka side, is more than just a famous mountain — it is a sacred symbol deeply tied to Japan's spiritual and cultural heritage. While many tourists visit to enjoy the view or challenge themselves with a climb, it's important to recognize that Fuji-san has long been a site of pilgrimage and worship. Treating it like a casual hike or photo spot can come off as insensitive. Always follow seasonal access rules, stay on marked trails, and respect any restricted areas. Littering, shouting, or playing music on the trail not only disturbs others but also goes against the respectful atmosphere that locals expect. Climbing Mt. Fuji is a special experience — approach it with humility and care.": "富士山，特别是从静冈一侧，不仅仅是一座著名的山——它是深深连接日本精神和文化遗产的神圣象征。虽然许多游客来欣赏景色或挑战登山，但重要的是要认识到富士山长期以来一直是朝圣和礼拜的场所。将其当作随意的徒步或拍照地点可能显得不敏感。始终遵循季节性访问规则，留在标记的小径上，并尊重任何限制区域。在小径上乱扔垃圾、喊叫或播放音乐不仅打扰他人，而且违背了当地人期望的尊重氛围。攀登富士山是一种特殊体验——以谦逊和谨慎的态度接近它。",

    "4. Gifu": "4. 岐阜",
    "1. Don't Touch or Enter Private Homes in Shirakawa-go": "1. 不要触摸或进入白川乡的私人住宅",
    "Shirakawa-go, with its iconic thatched-roof farmhouses, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site — but it's also a living village where people still reside. While some homes are open to the public as museums or inns, many others are private properties. Tourists should be careful not to treat the entire village like an open-air exhibit. Avoid touching the wooden walls, peeking through windows, or walking into side paths marked as restricted. Even leaning on fences or standing too close for photos can feel intrusive to the residents. Respecting the privacy and daily lives of the locals helps preserve the harmony between tourism and tradition in this unique community.": "白川乡以其标志性的茅草屋顶农舍而闻名，是联合国教科文组织世界遗产——但它也是一个人们仍然居住的活村庄。虽然一些房屋作为博物馆或旅馆向公众开放，但许多其他房屋是私人财产。游客应该小心不要将整个村庄当作露天展览。避免触摸木墙、透过窗户窥视或走进标记为限制的侧道。即使是靠在围栏上或为了拍照站得太近也可能让居民感到侵入。尊重当地人的隐私和日常生活有助于在这个独特社区保持旅游与传统之间的和谐。",

    "2. Be Careful When Taking Photos in Traditional Towns Like Takayama": "2. 在高山等传统城镇拍照时要小心",
    "The historic streets of Takayama, especially areas like Sanmachi Suji, are beautifully preserved and attract many visitors with their Edo-period charm. However, these areas are not just tourist spots — they are also home to local residents and businesses. Tourists should avoid blocking narrow walkways, setting up tripods in busy areas, or taking photos of people or shop interiors without permission. Some places may have signs that say \"撮影禁止\" (no photography) — these should always be respected. Being mindful of your surroundings and photographing discreetly helps maintain the peaceful atmosphere that makes Takayama so special.": "高山的历史街道，特别是三町筋等地区，保存完好，以其江户时代的魅力吸引了许多游客。然而，这些地区不仅仅是旅游景点——它们也是当地居民和企业的家园。游客应该避免阻塞狭窄的走道、在繁忙区域设置三脚架，或未经许可拍摄人物或商店内部。一些地方可能有写着\"撮影禁止\"（禁止摄影）的标志——这些应该始终得到尊重。注意周围环境并谨慎拍照有助于保持使高山如此特别的宁静氛围。",

    "3. Don't Mishandle or Joke About Blades in Seki": "3. 不要在关市不当处理或开玩笑谈论刀具",
    "Seki City in Gifu is known across Japan — and even worldwide — for its masterful blade craftsmanship, with a history of sword-making that dates back over 700 years. Whether it's a samurai katana or a finely made kitchen knife, blades from Seki are treated with deep respect. When visiting knife shops, museums, or workshops, it's important to remember that these items are not souvenirs or toys. Avoid pretending to fight with them, posing for silly photos, or grabbing them without asking. Mishandling a blade not only risks injury but also shows a lack of appreciation for the cultural and spiritual significance behind the craft. Always handle them with care, and follow staff instructions when observing or purchasing.": "岐阜的关市以其精湛的刀具工艺而闻名于日本——甚至全世界，其制刀历史可追溯到700多年前。无论是武士刀还是精心制作的厨房刀，关市的刀具都受到深深的尊重。参观刀具店、博物馆或工作室时，重要的是要记住这些物品不是纪念品或玩具。避免假装与它们战斗、摆出愚蠢的照片姿势，或未经询问就抓取它们。不当处理刀具不仅有受伤的风险，而且表明对工艺背后的文化和精神意义缺乏欣赏。始终小心处理它们，在观察或购买时遵循工作人员的指示。",

    "4. Don't Dance Carelessly in Gujo Odori": "4. 不要在郡上舞中随意跳舞",
    "Gujo Odori, held in Gujo Hachiman, is one of Japan's longest and most cherished traditional dance festivals, running for over 30 nights each summer. Unlike stage performances, this is a community-centered event where locals and visitors dance together in the streets to preserve centuries-old traditions. While tourists are warmly welcomed to join, it's important to follow the rhythm and style of the dances rather than freestyle or make exaggerated moves. Watch others, learn the basic steps, and join with respect. Taking over the circle, filming in the center, or treating it as a performance for social media can be seen as disrespectful. The heart of Gujo Odori is in dancing with the community — not standing out from it.": "在郡上八幡举行的郡上舞是日本最长久和最受珍视的传统舞蹈节之一，每年夏天持续30多个夜晚。与舞台表演不同，这是一个以社区为中心的活动，当地人和游客在街上一起跳舞以保护数百年历史的传统。虽然游客受到热烈欢迎参加，但重要的是要遵循舞蹈的节奏和风格，而不是即兴发挥或做出夸张的动作。观察他人，学习基本步骤，并尊重地加入。占据圆圈、在中央拍摄或将其视为社交媒体表演可能被认为是不尊重的。郡上舞的核心是与社区一起跳舞——而不是从中脱颖而出。",

    "5. Don't Interrupt or Flash Photography During Cormorant Fishing (Ukai)": "5. 在鸬鹚捕鱼（鵜飼い）期间不要打断或使用闪光灯摄影",
    "Ukai, or traditional cormorant fishing, is a centuries-old ritual held on the Nagara River in Gifu City. It's not just a tourist show — it's a living cultural heritage, performed with deep skill and spiritual significance. As night falls, fishermen in traditional robes guide trained cormorants to catch fish by torchlight, creating a quiet and mesmerizing scene. Tourists are welcome to watch, but flash photography is strictly discouraged, as it can startle the birds and break their concentration. Likewise, shouting, cheering, or waving from boats is considered disruptive. To truly appreciate Ukai, observe silently, keep your camera settings on low light or no flash, and let the ancient rhythm of the performance speak for itself.": "鵜飼い，或传统鸬鹚捕鱼，是在岐阜市长良河上举行的数百年历史的仪式。这不仅仅是一场旅游表演——它是活的文化遗产，以深厚的技能和精神意义进行。夜幕降临时，穿着传统长袍的渔民在火把的照耀下引导训练有素的鸬鹚捕鱼，创造出宁静而迷人的场景。欢迎游客观看，但严格不鼓励使用闪光灯摄影，因为它会惊吓鸟类并破坏它们的注意力。同样，从船上喊叫、欢呼或挥手被认为是破坏性的。要真正欣赏鵜飼い，请静默观察，将相机设置保持在低光或无闪光模式，让表演的古老节奏自己说话。",
