    "Introduction to the Kyushu & Okinawa Region": "九州・沖縄地方の紹介",
    "Kyushu & Okinawa region": "九州・沖縄地方",
    "Located in the southwest of Japan, Kyushu and Okinawa offer a vibrant contrast to the country's more urbanized regions. Kyushu, Japan's third-largest island, is known for its dramatic volcanoes, historic samurai towns, hot spring resorts, and rich culinary traditions.": "日本の南西部に位置する九州・沖縄地方は、都市化された他の地域とは対照的な、活気に満ちた魅力を持っています。九州は日本で3番目に大きい島で、火山、歴史的な侍の町、温泉、豊かな食文化で有名です。",
    "With seven diverse prefectures — including Fukuoka, Kumamoto, and Nagasaki — Kyushu blends modern innovation with deep cultural roots, such as yatai street food, active volcanoes like Mt. Aso, and Christian heritage sites. Just to the south, the Okinawa Islands form a tropical chain with a unique identity influenced by their history as the Ryukyu Kingdom. Okinawa is famous for its emerald beaches, distinctive music and dance, and one of the world's longest-living populations. Together, Kyushu and Okinawa offer a deeply local, welcoming, and unforgettable side of Japan far from the big cities.": "福岡、熊本、長崎など7つの多様な県があり、屋台のストリートフード、阿蘇山のような活火山、キリスト教の史跡など、現代的な革新と深い文化的ルーツが融合しています。その南に位置する沖縄諸島は、琉球王国としての歴史に影響を受けた独自のアイデンティティを持つ熱帯の島々です。エメラルドグリーンのビーチ、独特の音楽と踊り、そして世界有数の長寿地域として有名です。九州と沖縄は、大都市から離れた、地域に根ざした、温かく忘れられない日本の側面を提供してくれます。",

    "1. Fukuoka": "1. 福岡",
    "1. Don't Stay Too Long at Yatai (Street Food Stalls)": "1. 屋台での長居は禁物",
    "Yatai, or street food stalls, are one of Fukuoka's most beloved cultural experiences, offering warm food and friendly conversation in a small, casual setting. However, seating is limited and turnover is important — these stalls are designed for quick, social meals, not long dinners. After enjoying your food and perhaps a short chat, it's polite to make space for others waiting to sit. Lingering too long, especially during busy evening hours, can unintentionally inconvenience both the stall owner and other customers. Being mindful of your time at the yatai helps keep this special tradition alive and welcoming for everyone.": "屋台は福岡で最も愛されている文化体験の一つで、小さくカジュアルな空間で温かい食事とフレンドリーな会話を楽しめます。ただし、席数が限られているため、長居は控えましょう。食事を終えたら、他の人のために席を譲るのがマナーです。特に混雑時は長居すると迷惑になることがあります。屋台での時間を意識することで、この伝統を守ることができます。",

    "2. Don't Eat or Drink Around Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine Grounds": "2. 太宰府天満宮の境内での飲食は避ける",
    "Dazaifu Tenmangu is one of Fukuoka's most important and sacred shrines, dedicated to the deity of learning, Sugawara no Michizane. While the approach to the shrine is lined with lively shops selling sweets and souvenirs — including the famous ume mochi rice cakes — once you pass through the torii gate, it's important to shift your behavior. Eating or drinking inside the shrine grounds is considered disrespectful, as the area is a place for prayer, reflection, and quiet. Be sure to finish any snacks or drinks before entering, and always bow respectfully when passing through sacred spaces. Keeping this etiquette helps preserve the solemn atmosphere that worshippers and locals deeply value.": "太宰府天満宮は福岡で最も重要で神聖な神社の一つです。参道にはお菓子やお土産の店が並びますが、鳥居をくぐったら飲食は控えましょう。境内は祈りや静寂の場なので、飲食は失礼にあたります。入る前に食べ終え、神聖な空間ではお辞儀を忘れずに。",

    "3. Don't Imitate or Interrupt Hakata Gion Yamakasa Participants": "3. 博多祇園山笠の参加者の真似や妨害はしない",
    "The Hakata Gion Yamakasa is one of Fukuoka's most iconic and sacred festivals, held every July for over 770 years. During this event, teams of men dressed in traditional attire carry massive wooden floats and race through the streets of Hakata in a powerful display of teamwork, speed, and devotion. While tourists are encouraged to watch and enjoy, it's important to respect the spiritual and cultural significance of the event. Never try to join the runners, mimic their actions, or step into their path for photos. Doing so not only disrupts the flow of the procession but also shows disrespect toward the local community that trains and prepares all year for this festival. Enjoy the energy from a safe distance and honor the tradition by observing quietly and respectfully.": "博多祇園山笠は福岡を象徴する神聖な祭りです。観光客も観覧できますが、参加者の真似や進路の妨害、写真撮影のために近づくのは控えましょう。伝統と地域社会への敬意を持って、静かに見守ることが大切です。",

    "4. Don't Confuse Mentaiko with Common Spicy Paste": "4. 明太子をただの辛いペーストと混同しない",
    "In Fukuoka, mentaiko — spicy cod roe — is more than just a condiment; it's a beloved local delicacy with a deep cultural identity. Unlike generic spicy sauces or pastes, Fukuoka's mentaiko is carefully marinated in a secret blend of chili, sake, and seasonings, with each shop offering its own unique flavor profile. Tourists sometimes mistake it for just another \"spicy spread,\" but doing so overlooks its richness, subtle heat, and importance in Hakata cuisine. Whether it's served with rice, in pasta, or even on baguettes, mentaiko is meant to be appreciated like fine cheese or artisan miso — not dismissed as something ordinary. Trying it with an open mind shows respect for local food culture and the generations of craftsmanship behind each bite.": "福岡の明太子は単なる辛いペーストではなく、地元の誇りある名物です。各店ごとに味付けが異なり、博多料理に欠かせません。普通の辛い調味料と混同せず、ぜひ本場の味を楽しんでください。",

    "2. Oita": "2. 大分",
    "1.Don't Treat Onsen Like Pools or Spas": "1.温泉をプールやスパのように扱わない",
    "Ōita, especially cities like Beppu and Yufuin, is famous for its incredible variety of hot springs — but these are not the same as Western-style spas or swimming pools. For locals, onsen are places of healing, relaxation, and tradition, and they come with long-established etiquette. Visitors should never splash, swim, or dive into the water. Before entering, you must wash and rinse your body thoroughly at the provided shower area. Towels should never go into the bath itself — leave them on the side or place a small towel on your head. Speaking quietly is also expected, and using phones or taking photos is usually forbidden. Respecting these customs ensures that everyone — locals and tourists — can enjoy the peaceful onsen experience together.": "大分県、特に別府や湯布院は多様な温泉で有名ですが、温泉は西洋式のスパやプールとは異なります。温泉は癒しと伝統の場であり、マナーを守ることが大切です。水しぶきをあげたり泳いだりせず、入浴前は体をよく洗いましょう。タオルは湯船に入れず、静かに過ごし、写真撮影や携帯電話の使用も控えましょう。",

    "2. Don't Be Surprised by Mixed-Gender Baths": "2. 混浴に驚かない",
    "In some rural areas of Ōita Prefecture, especially in traditional or historic hot springs, you may encounter mixed-gender baths, known as konyoku (混浴). While uncommon in most parts of Japan today, konyoku is still practiced in certain regions of Ōita where it's seen as part of the local culture, not something strange or inappropriate. These baths often have modesty rules — such as towels, bathing wear, or gender-separated times — but the atmosphere remains relaxed and respectful. If you're uncomfortable, simply ask the staff if there's a private or gender-specific option available. Most importantly, avoid reacting loudly, laughing, or staring — treating the experience with quiet respect honors the traditions of the local community": "大分の一部地域では、伝統的な温泉で混浴が残っています。驚いたり大声を出したりせず、静かに体験しましょう。抵抗がある場合はスタッフに相談すれば、貸切や男女別の選択肢もあります。",

    "3. Don't Touch Bamboo Crafts Without Permission": "3. 許可なく竹細工に触れない",
    "Ōita, especially Beppu, is renowned for its traditional bamboo craftsmanship, with finely woven baskets, trays, and decorative items that often take days or even weeks to create by hand. These crafts are not mass-produced souvenirs — they are delicate works of art that reflect generations of skill and care. When visiting bamboo craft shops, galleries, or exhibitions, it's important to look with your eyes, not your hands, unless signs say it's okay. Many items are fragile or made for display only, and touching without permission could damage them or be considered disrespectful. If you're interested in a piece, politely ask the staff for help — they'll usually be happy to show it to you properly.": "大分、特に別府は伝統的な竹細工で有名です。繊細な工芸品なので、許可なく手を触れず、興味があればスタッフに声をかけましょう。",

    "4. Don't Take Photos Inside Onsen Facilities": "4. 温泉施設内での写真撮影はしない",
    "In Ōita's famous onsen towns like Beppu and Yufuin, photography inside bathing areas is strictly discouraged — and often outright prohibited. Onsen are places of privacy, relaxation, and personal comfort, and taking photos can make other guests feel uncomfortable or exposed, especially since everyone is bathing nude. Even in outdoor baths or scenic hot spring areas, if people are present, it's best to avoid using cameras or smartphones altogether. Some sightseeing spots, like the \"hells\" (jigoku), allow photos — but bathing areas do not. Always check for signs, and when in doubt, ask staff. Respecting others' privacy helps preserve the calm, welcoming spirit of the onsen experience.": "別府や湯布院などの温泉街では、入浴エリアでの写真撮影は禁止です。プライバシーを守り、他の利用者に配慮しましょう。",

    "5. Don't Waste Local Foods Like Toriten or Dangojiru": "5. とり天やだんご汁などの郷土料理を残さない",
    "Ōita is proud of its regional dishes like toriten (crispy chicken tempura) and dangojiru (miso soup with hand-rolled dumplings and vegetables), both rooted in local home cooking and tradition. These meals are more than just food — they represent the heart of Ōita's culinary identity. When dining in local restaurants or inns, it's considered respectful to finish what you're served, or at least try most of it. Leaving food uneaten, especially after showing strong curiosity to try it, may come across as wasteful or impolite. If you're unsure about the portion size or flavor, it's best to order small and add more later. Showing appreciation — even with a simple \"gochisousama deshita\" after the meal — goes a long way in honoring local hospitality.": "大分の郷土料理は地元の誇りです。注文した料理はできるだけ残さず食べ、食後は「ごちそうさまでした」と感謝を伝えましょう。",

    "3. Okinawa": "3. 沖縄",
    "1.Don't Ignore Umbrella Etiquette on Rainy Days": "1.沖縄独自の琉球文化を忘れない",
    "Okinawa may be part of Japan today, but it was once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom with its own language, culture, and traditions. This unique heritage is still deeply felt by the local people. Assuming that Okinawa is culturally identical to mainland Japan — or treating it like just another tropical tourist spot — can come off as ignorant or disrespectful. Locals are proud of their distinct identity, which blends Ryukyuan roots with a mix of Japanese and American influences. Visitors who take the time to learn about Okinawa's history, listen to its music, taste its traditional food, and appreciate its differences are warmly welcomed. Showing curiosity and respect goes a long way in connecting with the Okinawan spirit.": "沖縄はかつて琉球王国として独自の文化を持っていました。本土と同じと考えず、歴史や伝統、音楽や食文化の違いを尊重しましょう。",

    "2. Show Respect When Drinking Awamori": "2. 泡盛を飲む際は敬意を払う",
    "Awamori is Okinawa's traditional distilled liquor, made from long-grain Thai rice and aged in clay pots for a smooth, rich flavor. It's more than just a drink — it's a cultural symbol often shared during celebrations, family gatherings, and even spiritual rituals. When offered awamori, it's polite to receive it with both hands and return the gesture by pouring for others. Chugging it like a shot or treating it as a party drink can be seen as disrespectful, especially in more traditional settings. Locals value the slow, social nature of drinking — it's about connection, not speed. Savoring awamori and honoring the custom of mutual hospitality reflects genuine appreciation for Okinawan culture.": "泡盛は沖縄の伝統的な蒸留酒です。両手で受け取り、他の人にも注ぐのが礼儀です。一気飲みやパーティードリンクのように扱わず、ゆっくり味わいましょう。",

    "3. Don't Walk on Sacred Utaki Sites": "3. 神聖な御嶽（うたき）に立ち入らない",
    "In Okinawa, utaki are sacred sites deeply connected to the island's indigenous Ryukyuan spirituality. These places — often groves, caves, or stone formations — are considered dwellings of gods and ancestral spirits. Many utaki are still actively used for prayer and rituals, especially by local women known as noro (priestesses). Tourists may come across these sites in forests, near beaches, or even along hiking trails. While they may look like natural landmarks, stepping into them, touching altars, or taking casual photos can be seen as highly disrespectful. When in doubt, observe from a distance and follow local signs or guidance. Showing reverence to these quiet spiritual spaces reflects true respect for Okinawa's living traditions.": "御嶽（うたき）は沖縄の神聖な場所です。森や岩場などで見かけても、勝手に立ち入ったり写真を撮ったりせず、遠くから静かに見守りましょう。",

    "4. Be Sensitive About War History": "4. 戦争の歴史に配慮する",
    "Okinawa was the site of one of the most devastating battles of World War II, and the scars of that conflict are still deeply felt by its people. The Battle of Okinawa claimed over 200,000 lives — including many civilians — and left lasting trauma on the island. Today, places like the Okinawa Peace Memorial Park, Himeyuri Monument, and Former Japanese Navy Underground Headquarters stand as solemn reminders of that tragedy. Visitors are expected to approach these sites with quiet respect and reflection. Making jokes, taking cheerful selfies, or making light comments about war or the U.S. military presence can deeply offend locals. Understanding the pain and resilience behind Okinawa's peace message is key to appreciating the island beyond its beaches and beauty.": "沖縄は第二次世界大戦の激戦地でした。平和祈念公園やひめゆりの塔などでは、静かに敬意を持って見学しましょう。冗談や軽率な発言は控えてください。",

    "4. Miyazaki": "4. 宮崎",
    "1. Respect for Shinto Mythology Sites": "1. 神話の聖地への敬意",
    "Miyazaki is deeply connected to the roots of Japanese mythology, with sacred locations like Takachiho Gorge, Amano-Iwato Shrine, and Udo Shrine tied to ancient legends about the gods, including the sun goddess Amaterasu. These aren't just sightseeing spots — they are spiritual places where locals come to pray, reflect, and honor their cultural heritage. Visitors should remain quiet, avoid disruptive behavior, and dress modestly when visiting these sites. Taking loud selfies, ignoring shrine etiquette (like bowing or washing hands), or treating the myths as mere folklore can come across as disrespectful. Understanding and honoring the spiritual meaning behind these places allows for a much deeper and more respectful connection to Miyazaki's cultural soul.": "宮崎は日本神話の聖地が多い地域です。高千穂峡や天岩戸神社などでは、静かに参拝し、神社の作法や服装にも気を配りましょう。",

    "2. Surfing with Aloha Spirit": "2. アロハスピリットでサーフィンを楽しむ",
    "Miyazaki is a renowned surfing destination, celebrated for its scenic beaches and perfect waves. However, surfing here is not just about riding waves — it's about embracing the Aloha spirit, which emphasizes respect, humility, and community. When visiting local surf spots, such as Aoshima Beach or Kushima, it's important to follow surf etiquette. This includes waiting your turn, respecting local surfers, and avoiding aggressive behavior in the water. The vibe is laid-back, with an emphasis on camaraderie and harmony, rather than competition. Being considerate of others and appreciating the natural beauty of the surroundings will ensure a positive experience and demonstrate respect for the local surfing culture.": "宮崎はサーフィンの名所ですが、地元の人や自然への敬意を忘れず、順番やマナーを守りましょう。競争よりも調和を大切にする雰囲気です。",

    "3. Respect the Nature and Spiritual Energy": "3. 自然とスピリチュアルなエネルギーを尊重する",
    "Miyazaki is known not only for its stunning landscapes but also for its powerful spiritual energy, especially in places like Aoshima Island, Udo Shrine, and the surrounding coastlines. Locals believe these natural spots are filled with sacred power — known as power spots (パワースポット) — where people go to pray, heal, or feel connected to something greater. While the scenery may tempt visitors to explore freely or pose for dramatic photos, it's important to stay on marked paths, avoid climbing sacred rocks, and keep noise to a minimum. These areas are treated with quiet reverence, not just as tourist spots but as spiritual sanctuaries. Respecting the natural and mystical essence of these places helps preserve both the environment and the spiritual atmosphere that makes Miyazaki so unique.": "宮崎の自然やパワースポットでは、決められた道を歩き、神聖な岩に登らず、静かに過ごしましょう。観光地であっても、地元の人の信仰心を尊重してください。"
