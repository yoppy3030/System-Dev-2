            "Don't Eat While Walking": "请勿边走边吃",
            "In Japan, you won't see people eating on the streets, as eating while walking is seen as impolite. Whether it's delicious takoyaki or matcha ice cream, finish your snacks at a stall or find a quiet spot. If you take your foods with you, there are no public trash bins on the streets, so littering will be a problem.": "在日本，你几乎不会看到人们在街上吃东西，因为边走边吃被视为不礼貌的行为。无论是美味的章鱼烧还是抹茶冰淇淋，都应该在摊位前或找个安静的地方吃完。如果你带着食物，要注意街上很少有公共垃圾桶，所以乱扔垃圾会成为问题。",

            "Don't Talk on Your Phone on Trains, or in Cafés": "请勿在电车或咖啡厅打电话",
            "Japanese trains and subways are quiet places. Avoid talking on your phone when on a train. On some trains, there are even signs indicating travelers should set their phones to silent mode. If you need to answer a phone call, tell the people that you are on a train and will call back soon. Then, end the call quickly.": "日本的电车和地铁是安静的场所。在电车上要避免打电话。在一些电车上，甚至有标识提示乘客将手机调至静音模式。如果你必须接电话，请告诉对方你在电车上，稍后会回电。然后，尽快结束通话。",

            "Don't Wear Clothes While Soaking in Hot Springs": "泡温泉时不要穿衣物",
            "You are now allowed to wear bathing suits when soaking in Japanese onsens. You need to take off all your clothes and wash thoroughly before entering the baths. If you are too shy to follow this practice, book a private session. Many hotels have rooms with private hot springs, but the prices are very high and they are often very hard to book.": "在日本温泉中不允许穿泳衣。进入浴池前，你需要脱掉所有衣物并彻底清洗身体。如果你对此感到害羞，可以预订私人温泉。许多酒店都有带私人温泉的房间，但价格通常很高，而且往往很难预订。",

            "Don't Take Photos of Strangers": "不要给陌生人拍照",
            "People don't like to be photographed without their permission. Never point your camera at others, even at grandmothers in rural market areas. If you'd like to take photos of someone, ask them first, or have your guide to ask them.": "人们不喜欢未经许可被拍照。请勿将相机对准他人，即使是在乡村市场区域的老人。如果你想给某人拍照，请先征得他们的同意，或请导游代为询问。",

            "Don't Forget to Take Off Your Shoes When Going Indoors": "进入室内时请记得脱鞋",
            "Tourists visiting Japan need to be aware that wearing shoes inside certain places is something you should never do in Japan. Wearing outdoor shoes is deemed unhygienic by the Japanese so you will be expected to remove your shoes immediately when entering a Japanese home, schools, hospitals and certain restaurants and temples.": "访问日本的游客需要注意，在某些场所穿鞋是日本绝对不允许的。日本人认为穿室外鞋不卫生，所以在进入日本家庭、学校、医院以及某些餐厅和寺庙时，你需要立即脱鞋。",

            "Don't worry though, slippers are always provided. When you enter a building and you see a line of shoes at the entrance, then you know that you will be expected to remove your own.": "不过不用担心，通常都会提供室内拖鞋。当你进入建筑物，看到入口处有一排鞋子时，你就应该知道需要脱掉自己的鞋子。",

            "For tourists, you will most likely notice this at a traditional Japanese inn, at Japanese restaurants and of course inside shrines and temples. Also, another important rule to note is that you will be expected to exchange your slippers for 'toilet slippers' if you visit the loo. You'll see them at the bathroom door so you can't miss them don't forget to change back when you're finished though!": "作为游客，你最可能在传统日本旅馆、日本餐厅以及神社和寺庙内部注意到这一点。另外，还有一个重要的规则需要注意：如果你去洗手间，需要将拖鞋换成'厕所专用拖鞋'。你会在洗手间门口看到它们，所以不会错过，但请记得用完后要换回普通拖鞋！",

            "Don't Leave A Tip In Japan": "在日本不要给小费",
            "Unlike many other countries around the world, tipping is simply not the done thing in Japan. It's not rude as such but it is definitely not expected. And don't be surprised if you find a waiter/waitress chasing after you if you do leave money on the table It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable with this concept if you come from a country where tipping is prevalent.": "与世界许多其他国家不同，在日本给小费不是习俗。这并不算无礼，但绝对不是人们所期望的。如果你在桌上留下钱，看到服务员追出来还给你，也不要感到惊讶。如果你来自小费文化盛行的国家，对这种概念感到不适应是完全正常的。",

            "Simply try to keep in mind that it is just not expected and trying to tip will only lead to confusion. However, there is one exception if you take a tour during your time in Japan, it is always acceptable (but again not expected) to give your tour guide a small tip. Make sure to wrap and fold the tip in paper and politely hand it to your guide using both hands.": "请记住，在日本不需要给小费，尝试给小费只会造成困惑。不过，有一个例外：如果你在日本期间参加旅游团，给导游小费是可以接受的（但同样不是必需的）。给小费时，记得将钱用纸包好并折叠，然后用双手礼貌地递给导游。",

            "Wash your entire body before entering the hot springs.": "进入温泉前请清洗全身",
            "There will be a shower area with individual faucets with small stools where one can sit and scrub themselves down. After thoroughly showering and rinsing yourself off, rinse down your washing area, including the stool you sat on! Body soap and shampoo are also provided, but you can bring your own if you wish.": "温泉设施会有淋浴区，配有单独的水龙头和小凳子，你可以坐在那里彻底清洗身体。洗完澡后，请冲洗你使用的区域，包括你坐过的凳子！一般会提供沐浴露和洗发水，但如果你愿意，也可以自带。",
