         <h1>Introduction to the ChugokuRegion</h1>
         <p>
            The Chugoku region, located in western Honshu, is a land of striking contrasts — from bustling port cities to tranquil mountain villages, and from ancient shrines to industrial hubs. Comprising five prefectures — Hiroshima, Okayama, Shimane, Tottori, and Yamaguchi
             — Chugoku offers a rich blend of history, nature, and regional identity. Hiroshima stands as a global symbol of peace and resilience, while places like Izumo in Shimane preserve deep spiritual traditions rooted in Japan's oldest myths. The region is also known for its scenic coastline,
              fresh seafood, traditional crafts, and unique dialects. Whether exploring the peaceful sand dunes of Tottori or walking across the legendary Kintai Bridge in Yamaguchi, visitors to Chugoku can experience a quieter, more reflective side of Japan, steeped in both historical gravity and local pride.
</p>

                   <li>
                            <h3>1. Avoid Political Jokes About the Atomic Bomb</h3>
                            <p>In Hiroshima, the memory of the atomic bombing is not just a part of history — it's a living, deeply emotional reality for many residents. As such, even casual jokes, political comments, 
                                or lighthearted references to nuclear weapons or war can be seen as deeply insensitive. Locals expect visitors to approach the subject with empathy and seriousness. Making remarks, no matter how harmless they may seem elsewhere, 
                                can cause discomfort or offense. When visiting memorials or speaking with locals, it's important to show respect for the city's tragic past and its ongoing message of peace.</p>
                        </li>
                    
                        <li>
                            <h3>2.  Listen Closely to Dialect: Hiroshima-ben    </h3>
                            <p>The local dialect spoken in Hiroshima, known as Hiroshima-ben, is rich, expressive, and distinctly different from standard Japanese. It often sounds strong or even aggressive to outsiders, but it reflects the warmth and honesty of the people.
                                 Phrases like "じゃけえ" (meaning "so" or "because"), "ぶち" (meaning "very"), or "いけん" (meaning "not good" or "don't do that") are commonly used in everyday speech. While it might sound intense, locals don't mean to be rude — it's simply their way of speaking.
                                  Visitors are encouraged to listen and appreciate the uniqueness of this dialect, and even trying out a few Hiroshima-ben phrases can help connect more deeply with the community.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>3.  Folded Paper Cranes Are Sacred</h3>
                            <img src="./img/paper_cranes.jpg" alt="Hiroshima Orizuru" class="origami-image"><br>
                            <p>In Hiroshima, folded paper cranes — known as orizuru — are powerful symbols of peace, hope, and remembrance, especially connected to the story of Sadako Sasaki, a young girl who died from radiation after the atomic bombing.
                                 Visitors often bring thousands of these colorful cranes to the Peace Memorial Park as heartfelt offerings. While they may look like decorations, these cranes carry deep emotional weight and personal prayers.
                                  Touching, rearranging, or taking them is considered highly disrespectful. Tourists are expected to observe them quietly and understand their meaning — each crane represents a wish for a world without war.</p>

                            <h3>4. Quiet Respect at Peace Memorial Sites</h3>
                            <p>The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is not just a tourist attraction — it is a solemn space dedicated to the memory of the victims of the atomic bombing and a symbol of Hiroshima's call for global peace. 
                                Locals and survivors visit the park to mourn, reflect, and pray. As such, visitors are expected to behave with deep respect. Talking loudly, laughing, running around, or taking cheerful selfies in front of memorials like the Atomic Bomb Dome or the Children's Peace Monument can be seen as deeply inappropriate. 
                                Maintaining a quiet, respectful presence honors both the history and the ongoing message of peace that Hiroshima continues to share with the world.<p>

                    <h2>2. Okayama  </h2>

                        <li>
                            <h3>1. Respect for the Legend of Momotaro</h3>
                            <p>Okayama is widely known as the birthplace of Momotaro, the legendary Peach Boy hero from Japanese folklore. For locals, Momotaro is more than just a children's story — he's a cultural symbol of bravery, kindness, and local pride.
                                 His image appears on everything from souvenirs and trains to statues and sweets like kibidango. While visitors are welcome to enjoy and engage with the story, mocking the tale, making inappropriate jokes, or treating it as merely a funny cartoon can come across as disrespectful.
                                  Showing appreciation for the legend and its significance helps visitors connect more deeply with the spirit of Okayama.</p>
                        </li>
                    
                        <li>

                            <img src="./img/okayama_castle.jpg" alt="Okayama Castle" class="castle-image"><br>
                            <p>Okayama Castle, often called the "Crow Castle" for its striking black exterior, is a proud symbol of the city's history and culture. While it has been reconstructed, it remains a place of quiet appreciation and learning. Visitors are expected to behave respectfully inside the castle grounds —
                                 this means speaking softly, not touching exhibits, and avoiding casual or loud selfies in sacred or historical areas. It's also considered poor manners to run or act playfully inside the castle, especially around traditional displays and cultural artifacts. Treating the space like a living museum, 
                                 with curiosity and respect, honors the legacy the castle represents.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>3. Manners on the Kibi Plain Cycling Route</h3>
                            <p>The Kibi Plain Cycling Route is one of Okayama's most scenic and culturally rich paths, stretching through tranquil rice fields, ancient shrines, and historic burial mounds. While it's a popular destination for cyclists, it's not a race track or entertainment zone. Locals expect visitors to ride at a calm pace,
                                 avoid blasting music, and show respect to the rural surroundings. Greeting farmers with a nod, slowing down near shrines, and refraining from loud conversations helps preserve the peaceful atmosphere. Treating the route as a shared cultural space — not just a tourist activity — shows mindfulness and earns quiet appreciation from the community.</p>

                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>4. Reverence for Kibidango (きびだんご)</h3>
                            <p>Kibidango, a soft and slightly sweet dumpling made from millet flour, is one of Okayama's most iconic local treats — famously associated with the folk hero Momotaro. While it may look like a simple snack to visitors, kibidango carries cultural significance for the people of Okayama. It represents hospitality, tradition, and the enduring spirit of the Momotaro legend. 
                                Tossing it, making jokes about its texture, or treating it like cheap candy can be seen as disrespectful. Locals appreciate when tourists enjoy kibidango with sincerity, perhaps even learning its connection to the folklore. Eating it with gratitude is more than good manners — it's a quiet way to honor local pride.<p>

                            <h3>1.Don't Treat the Tottori Sand Dunes Like a Beach</h3>
                            <p>The Tottori Sand Dunes are one of Japan's most unique natural landmarks, stretching along the Sea of Japan with stunning desert-like landscapes. While they may resemble a beach or desert playground, locals view the dunes as a precious and fragile environment.
                                 Activities like shouting, playing sports, digging, or leaving trash are considered highly disrespectful. The dunes are home to delicate ecosystems and are constantly shaped by wind and weather. Visitors are expected to walk carefully, stay on designated paths, 
                                 and treat the area with quiet appreciation. Preserving the natural beauty of the dunes isn't just about following rules — it's about respecting a symbol of Tottori's identity.</p>

                            <h3>2.  Manga Manners in Mizuki Shigeru Road</h3>
                                <p>Mizuki Shigeru Road in Sakaiminato is a lively street dedicated to the beloved manga artist Mizuki Shigeru, creator of GeGeGe no Kitaro. The area is filled with bronze statues of yokai (Japanese spirits), manga art, and themed shops — attracting fans from all over the world.
                                     While it's a fun and interactive space, it's important to remember that this street is also a place of cultural pride and local daily life. Climbing on statues, blocking pathways for selfies, or behaving loudly in costume can disturb the respectful atmosphere.
                                      Visitors are encouraged to enjoy the area with care, ask for permission when photographing others (especially cosplayers), and treat the works of Mizuki Shigeru with the reverence they deserve.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>3. Don't Waste Your Butadon</h3>
                                <p>Obihiro is the proud birthplace of Butadon — a delicious rice bowl topped with grilled pork and sweet-savory sauce. This dish isn't just a local specialty; it represents the region's rich agricultural culture and high-quality pork production. For locals, Butadon is comfort food with deep meaning, often linked to family meals and regional pride.
                                     When tourists order Butadon and leave most of it uneaten, it can feel disrespectful — especially in a place where people value food deeply and understand the effort behind every ingredient. To show appreciation, visitors should only order what they can finish and take time to enjoy the flavor and care that goes into every bowl.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>4.  Respect the "Wagyu Capital"</h3>
                            <img src="./img/wagyu.jpg" alt="Tottori Wagyu" class="wagyu-image"><br>
                                <p>Tottori takes great pride in its wagyu heritage, often overlooked but deeply respected among beef connoisseurs. Known as the birthplace of some of Japan's finest black cattle, Tottori produces premium-quality wagyu like Tottori Kuroushi and Olein 55, known for its exceptional marbling and buttery texture. For locals, this isn't just food — 
                                    it's the result of generations of careful breeding and craftsmanship. When enjoying wagyu in Tottori, it's best to avoid comparing it to more famous varieties like Kobe or Matsusaka beef. Even light comments suggesting one is better than the other may come off as dismissive. Instead, 
                                    expressing genuine appreciation for the unique flavor and local pride behind Tottori wagyu shows cultural sensitivity and respect for what the region has perfected.</p>

                            <p>The Kintai Bridge in Iwakuni is one of Japan's most iconic wooden bridges, famous for its elegant five-arch design and centuries-old craftsmanship. While it may seem like a fun structure to explore, locals take its preservation very seriously. Running, jumping, 
                                or climbing on the arches is not only dangerous but also deeply disrespectful to a structure that symbolizes local pride and history. The bridge has been rebuilt and maintained with traditional techniques, making it more than just a sightseeing spot — it's a living piece of heritage.
                                 Visitors are expected to cross it slowly, take in the view with care, and treat it with the same respect as a historic monument.</p>

                            <p>Shimonoseki is Japan's top producer and culinary capital of fugu — the famously delicate and potentially poisonous blowfish. In this city, fugu isn't just exotic food; it's a symbol of refined skill and deep culinary tradition. Only licensed chefs are allowed to prepare it, often after years of training. 
                                Because of its dangerous reputation, some tourists are tempted to make jokes or light-hearted remarks about dying or taking risks while eating it. However, in Shimonoseki, such comments are seen as disrespectful to the chefs and the culture surrounding fugu. Locals expect diners to approach the experience with appreciation and quiet confidence, 
                                recognizing the care and technique behind every slice.</p>

                            <p>Yamaguchi's lantern festivals, especially the Tanabata Lantern Festival, are serene and spiritual events that light up the streets with soft, glowing beauty. During these festivals, thousands of handmade lanterns line roads and temple grounds, creating a peaceful and almost sacred atmosphere. 
                                While it's natural to want to take photos, pushing through crowds, using flash, or loudly chatting with friends can disrupt the mood that locals work hard to preserve. These festivals are not loud celebrations — they are moments of reflection, tradition, and quiet beauty. Visitors are encouraged to walk slowly, 
                                observe silently, and fully absorb the gentle magic of the lantern-lit night.</p>

                            <h3>4.Show Respect at Ruriko-ji Temple and Mori Clan Sites</h3>
                            <p>Ruriko-ji Temple in Yamaguchi is home to one of Japan's most beautiful five-story pagodas and is closely tied to the legacy of the Mori Clan, a powerful family that once ruled much of western Japan. These sacred sites are not just tourist attractions — they are places of deep historical and spiritual importance. 
                                Visitors should avoid loud conversations, casual selfies, or playful behavior within temple grounds and especially near the Mori family graves and memorials. Instead, a quiet, respectful presence is appreciated, whether you're walking through the mossy paths, viewing the pagoda, or offering a silent prayer.
                                 Showing reverence in these spaces honors both local culture and centuries of heritage.</p>
